# ESLint Next.js Plugin Detection Warning Status

The persistent warning about Next.js plugin detection has been addressed with multiple attempts:
- FlatCompat configuration approaches
- Various extends configurations  
- Different positioning in config array

The warning persists due to ESLint 9.x flat config compatibility issues with Next.js, but all linting functionality works correctly.
