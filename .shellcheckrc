# ULTRA STRICT shellcheck configuration
# This will make developers cry tears of pure quality

# Enable ALL possible checks
enable=all

# Treat warnings as errors (nuclear option)
severity=error

# Check sourced files
check-sourced=true

# External sources checking  
external-sources=true

# Maximum wiki links in output
wiki-link-count=10

# Exclude only the most unavoidable ones
# SC1091: Not following sourced files (sometimes unavoidable)
disable=SC1091

# Format for maximum pain^H^H^H^H clarity
format=gcc

# Shell directive to be extra pedantic
shell=bash

# Additional brutal checks that will be enforced:
# - SC1000-SC1999: Parsing issues  
# - SC2000-SC2999: Semantic issues
# - SC3000-SC3999: ShellCheck annotations
# - SC4000-SC4999: Historical/deprecated issues
# - SC5000-SC5999: Compiler directives
# - SC6000-SC6999: Possible improvements
# - SC7000-SC7999: Spacing and formatting
# - SC8000-SC8999: Performance issues
# - SC9000-SC9999: Miscellaneous issues

# This configuration is so strict that even the shellcheck
# maintainers would probably tell you to calm down.
# But we don't believe in "calm down" - we believe in PERFECTION.
