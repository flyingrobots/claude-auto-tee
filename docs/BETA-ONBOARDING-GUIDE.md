# Claude Auto-Tee Beta Testing Onboarding Guide

**Welcome to the claude-auto-tee beta testing program!**

Thank you for joining our beta testing group. This guide will help you get set up quickly and make the most of your testing experience.

## üéØ Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Join the private Discord server
- [ ] Access the private GitHub repository or download beta package
- [ ] Complete installation and basic setup
- [ ] Run your first test command
- [ ] Submit your first feedback (even if it's just "everything works!")

**Estimated Setup Time:** 15-30 minutes

## üìã What You're Testing

### Claude Auto-Tee Overview
Claude Auto-Tee automatically captures command output to temporary files when using Claude Code, solving the problem of having to re-run expensive commands to reference previous results.

**Before claude-auto-tee:**
```bash
# User runs expensive command
npm run build    # Takes 2 minutes
# Claude Code can't see the output, user has to re-run
```

**With claude-auto-tee:**
```bash
# Command automatically captured
npm run build | tee /tmp/claude-auto-tee-xyz.log
# Claude Code can reference the saved output file
```

### Key Features to Test
1. **Automatic Pipe Detection** - Tool detects when commands need output capture
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Works on macOS, Linux, Windows WSL
3. **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation when things go wrong
4. **Resource Management** - Efficient temp file cleanup and space usage
5. **Integration** - Seamless workflow with existing Claude Code usage

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Private Repository Access
If you received GitHub repository access:

```bash
# Clone the beta repository
git clone https://github.com/flyingrobots/claude-auto-tee-beta.git
cd claude-auto-tee-beta

# Make the script executable
chmod +x src/claude-auto-tee.sh

# Test basic functionality
./src/claude-auto-tee.sh --version
```

### Option 2: Beta Package Download
If you received a direct download link:

```bash
# Download and extract (replace URL with provided link)
curl -L [BETA_DOWNLOAD_URL] -o claude-auto-tee-beta.tar.gz
tar -xzf claude-auto-tee-beta.tar.gz
cd claude-auto-tee-beta

# Make executable and test
chmod +x claude-auto-tee.sh
./claude-auto-tee.sh --version
```

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### macOS
```bash
# Add to PATH (optional)
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)"
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:'$(pwd)'"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Test with a simple command
echo "Hello World" | ./claude-auto-tee.sh
```

#### Linux
```bash
# Add to PATH (optional)
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)"
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:'$(pwd)'"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Test with system command
ls -la | ./claude-auto-tee.sh
```

#### Windows WSL
```bash
# Ensure WSL integration
which bash  # Should show WSL bash path

# Test with Windows-specific scenarios
cmd.exe /c "dir" | ./claude-auto-tee.sh
```

### Verification
Run these commands to verify installation:

```bash
# Basic functionality test
echo "Installation test" | ./claude-auto-tee.sh

# Check if temp file was created
ls /tmp/claude-auto-tee-*

# Verify content
cat /tmp/claude-auto-tee-* | head -5
```

## üìä Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Week 1)
**Focus:** Basic pipe detection and tee injection

**Test Scenarios:**
```bash
# Simple commands
echo "test" | ./claude-auto-tee.sh
date | ./claude-auto-tee.sh
ls -la | ./claude-auto-tee.sh

# Build commands (if applicable)
npm run build | ./claude-auto-tee.sh
make | ./claude-auto-tee.sh
docker build . | ./claude-auto-tee.sh

# Long-running commands
find /usr -name "*.so" | ./claude-auto-tee.sh
```

**What to Report:**
- Does installation work smoothly?
- Do commands execute normally?
- Are temp files created with expected content?
- Any error messages or unusual behavior?

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week 2-3)
**Focus:** Error handling, verbose mode, cross-platform compatibility

**Test Scenarios:**
```bash
# Error conditions
./claude-auto-tee.sh --nonexistent-flag
echo "test" | ./claude-auto-tee.sh --verbose

# Resource limits
# (We'll provide specific large-output tests)

# Platform-specific paths
# (Windows: C:\ paths, macOS: /Users, Linux: /home)
```

**What to Report:**
- How does error handling work?
- Is verbose mode helpful?
- Platform-specific issues or compatibility problems?
- Resource usage concerns?

### Phase 3: Integration & Workflow (Week 3-4)
**Focus:** Real-world usage in daily workflows

**Test Scenarios:**
- Use claude-auto-tee in your actual development workflow
- Try with your most common commands
- Test integration with existing scripts/aliases

**What to Report:**
- Does it fit naturally into your workflow?
- Any productivity improvements or hindrances?
- Missing features or enhancement ideas?
