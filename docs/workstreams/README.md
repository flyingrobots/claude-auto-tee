# GitHub-Native Wave Execution Workstreams

**Complete documentation for implementing dependency-driven wave execution using GitHub as the coordination platform**

## üìÅ Documentation Structure

### Primary Documents

1. **[github-native-workflow.md](./github-native-workflow.md)** - **Main Implementation Plan**
   - Complete 7-step task execution workflow
   - GitHub comment-based progress tracking
   - Team automation scripts and coordination
   - Wave transition mechanisms with filesystem sync
   - Quality gates, error handling, and recovery procedures

2. **[implementation-examples.md](./implementation-examples.md)** - **Real-world Examples**
   - Complete task execution example with GitHub comments timeline
   - Dashboard data structures and API responses
   - Wave transition scenarios and team coordination
   - Error recovery examples and escalation procedures
   - Success metrics and quality reports

## üéØ Key Innovation: GitHub-Native Coordination

### Instead of building custom coordination tools, we use GitHub's native features:

**Progress Tracking:** Issue comments with standardized formats
```bash
"‚úÖ Commit abc123def completes step 2 of 5

Implemented cross-platform temp directory detection...

Next: Add comprehensive test coverage"
```

**CI Integration:** PR-based validation with automated issue closure
```bash
"üéØ Completed task. Opened PR #42

‚úÖ Definition of done met
‚úÖ Tests added and passing  
‚úÖ Documentation updated

PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42"
```

**Wave Coordination:** Filesystem ready.txt + GitHub API validation
```bash
# Teams create ready files only after all PRs merged:
~/claude-wave-sync/job-20250812/wave-1/team-alpha.ready.txt
```

## üöÄ Major Improvements Over Original Plan

### 1. **Complete Audit Trail**
- Every action tracked via GitHub comments with timestamps
- Full development history preserved in PR commit logs
- CI failures and resolutions documented in real-time
- Team coordination visible through issue activity

### 2. **Zero Custom Infrastructure**
- Uses GitHub API instead of custom progress tracking
- Leverages GitHub's PR/issue integration (auto-close on merge)
- Filesystem sync for simple wave coordination
- Standard git workflow with established tooling

### 3. **Granular Progress Visibility**
```
Task Level:    P1.T001 ‚Üí P1.T002 ‚Üí P1.T003 (issue completion)
Step Level:    Step 1 ‚Üí Step 2 ‚Üí Step 3 (commit progress)
CI Level:      Draft ‚Üí Review ‚Üí CI Green ‚Üí Merged
Wave Level:    Wave 1 ‚Üí Sync ‚Üí Wave 2 ‚Üí Sync ‚Üí Wave 3
```

### 4. **Production-Ready Automation**
- **7 core scripts** handle complete task lifecycle
- **GitHub API integration** for comment posting and monitoring
- **Real-time dashboard** using GitHub webhooks
- **Quality gates** prevent broken code from advancing waves

## üõ† Implementation Components

### Team Automation Scripts
```bash
start-task.sh P1.T001           # Initialize task with GitHub comment
commit-progress.sh "description" # Commit and report step progress  
create-task-pr.sh P1.T001       # Create PR and start CI monitoring
monitor-ci.sh 42                # Track CI status, report failures
complete-task.sh P1.T001        # Merge PR, move to next task
mark-wave-complete.sh           # Signal wave completion via ready.txt
```

### Dashboard Integration
```javascript
// Real-time progress via GitHub API
const teamProgress = await github.rest.issues.listComments({
  issue_number: taskId,
  since: waveStartTime
});

// CI status monitoring  
const prChecks = await github.rest.checks.listForRef({
  ref: prBranch
});
```

### Wave Coordination
```bash
# Monitor for all teams ready
ls ~/claude-wave-sync/$JOB_ID/wave-1/*.ready.txt

# Validate via GitHub API that all tasks closed via merged PRs
validate_wave_completion_via_github $WAVE_NUMBER
```

## üìä Expected Outcomes

### Efficiency Gains
- **80% coordination overhead reduction** (2 sync points vs daily standups)
- **Linear team scaling** (more teams = proportionally faster waves)
- **90%+ team utilization** (no waiting for coordination meetings)
- **Complete development transparency** through GitHub audit trail

### Quality Improvements  
- **CI-driven validation** prevents broken code from advancing
- **Automated quality gates** ensure definition of done compliance
- **Comprehensive test coverage** required for task completion
- **Code review integration** maintains quality standards

### Project Management Benefits
- **Real-time progress visibility** through GitHub dashboard
- **Predictable delivery timelines** based on dependency analysis
- **Risk mitigation** through early detection of issues via comments
- **Historical data collection** for improving future estimates

## üé™ Ready for Execution

### Questions Answered

**Q: How do teams know what to work on?**
A: Task assignments in `team-{name}-wave-{n}-tasklist.md` with GitHub issue links

**Q: How is progress tracked without constant meetings?**  
A: GitHub comments provide granular, real-time progress with full audit trail

**Q: How do we ensure quality without sacrificing speed?**
A: CI validation, quality gates, and PR-based workflow ensure code quality while maintaining parallel execution

**Q: What happens when teams encounter issues?**
A: Standardized escalation via GitHub comments, comprehensive error recovery procedures, and team assistance protocols

**Q: How do we coordinate wave transitions?**
A: Filesystem ready.txt files + GitHub API validation ensures all tasks properly completed before wave advancement

### Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** the workflow documentation
2. **Implement core automation scripts** (estimated 1 week)
3. **Set up GitHub API integration** for dashboard (estimated 2-3 days)
4. **Test with pilot team** on subset of tasks (estimated 2-3 days)
5. **Deploy for full Phase 1 execution** (estimated 3-7 days depending on team size)
