GitHub-Native Wave Coordination ‚Äî Implementation Spec

Scope: Build a zero-friction, auditable, GitHub-only system to coordinate dependency-driven waves of work.
Core idea: One Wave Coordination Issue per wave; teams signal via slash commands; a bot validates readiness (tasks closed via merged PRs + checks green), updates a pinned JSON state block, and announces the transition when all teams are ready.
No emojis. No sidecar infra. No local ready.txt.

‚∏ª

Why this works
	‚Ä¢	Single source of truth: GitHub issues/PRs, comments, and checks are canonical + auditable.
	‚Ä¢	Low noise: One pinned JSON state block edited in place + concise bot comments.
	‚Ä¢	Deterministic gates: Readiness is validated, not self-declared.
	‚Ä¢	Scales linearly: Add teams, not meetings.

‚∏ª

1) Glossary
	‚Ä¢	Plan: A set of waves (e.g., ‚ÄúPhase 1‚Äù) tracked in tasks.yaml.
	‚Ä¢	Wave n: A dependency frontier executed in parallel by multiple teams.
	‚Ä¢	Team: A named group: alpha, beta, gamma (configured).
	‚Ä¢	Task: A GitHub issue with task_id (e.g., P1.T024) owned by a team and assigned to a wave.
	‚Ä¢	Coordination Issue: A single GH issue per wave used as the hub (commands, status, announcements).
	‚Ä¢	Coordinator: The bot (GitHub App/Action) that validates and updates status. Humans don‚Äôt flip state.

‚∏ª

2) Architecture (High level)
	‚Ä¢	Source of truth: tasks.yaml checked into the repo (wave, team, acceptance criteria, steps).
	‚Ä¢	Artifacts:
	‚Ä¢	A Wave Coordination Issue titled Wave {n} ¬∑ {plan_id} ¬∑ Coordination.
	‚Ä¢	Team task issues (P1.T###) with labels wave:{n}, team:{name}, status:*.
	‚Ä¢	PRs that close task issues (use ‚ÄúCloses #XYZ‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	A pinned comment (or issue body section) containing canonical JSON of wave status.
	‚Ä¢	Automation:
	‚Ä¢	Slash commands: /ready wave-1, /blocked reason:"...", /unready.
	‚Ä¢	Validation: All team tasks for wave are closed by merged PRs with required checks green.
	‚Ä¢	Transition: When all teams ready, bot posts announcement, flips a custom check-run (‚ÄúWave Gate: Wave {n}‚Äù) to ‚úÖ, and (optionally) opens next-wave issues.

4) Security & Permissions (required)
	‚Ä¢	GitHub App (preferred) with:
	‚Ä¢	Read: contents, metadata, pull requests, issues, checks
	‚Ä¢	Write: issues, issue comments, checks
	‚Ä¢	(Optional) deployments if you later gate via deployments
	‚Ä¢	Branch protections: required checks, required reviews (CODEOWNERS), squash merges, signed commits or DCO.
	‚Ä¢	CI permissions: permissions: contents:read, pull-requests:read, checks:write, issues:write.

5) Coordination Issue Template

Title: Wave {n} ¬∑ {plan_id} ¬∑ Coordination
Labels: coordination, wave:{n}

Body (top):

## Wave {n} Status

<!-- wave-state:DO-NOT-EDIT -->
```json
{
  "plan": "phase-1",
  "wave": 1,
  "tz": "UTC",
  "teams": {
    "alpha": {"status":"in_progress"},
    "beta":  {"status":"in_progress"},
    "gamma": {"status":"in_progress"}
  },
  "updated_at": "2025-08-12T00:00:00Z"
}

<!-- /wave-state -->


**Commands:**

/ready wave-1
/blocked reason:‚Äúawaiting review on PR #123‚Äù
/unready

**Rules:** Only team members (from `teams.yaml`/CODEOWNERS) may issue commands for their team.

---

# 6) Slash Commands (behavior)

- **`/ready wave-1`**  
  Bot validates **that team‚Äôs** wave tasks:
  - All issues labeled `wave:1` and `team:{name}` are **CLOSED** via **merged PRs** (not manual close).
  - Required checks green on associated PR merge.
  - Optional: coverage threshold, artifact presence, doc updated file pattern.
  If valid ‚Üí update JSON state to `"ready"`, post succinct ack.

- **`/blocked reason:"..."`**  
  Update JSON state to `"blocked"` with `reason`, timestamp. Optionally relabel tasks/issues `status:blocked`.

- **`/unready`**  
  Transition back to `"in_progress"`. Provide reason (optional).

**Validation notes**
- Time is in **UTC**.
- The bot is the **only** writer of the canonical JSON block.
- Human comments are allowed; machines parse the JSON only.

---

# 7) Canonical JSON state (schema)

```json
{
  "plan": "phase-1",
  "wave": 1,
  "teams": {
    "alpha": {
      "status": "ready|in_progress|blocked",

            }

Note: Real implementation should include retries, rate-limit backoff, strict parsing of the closedBy ‚Üí PR relationship and checks via GraphQL, UTC timestamps, and unit tests for the JSON block editor.

‚∏ª

9) Workflow (day-to-day)
	1.	Create wave issues: For each wave, open a Coordination Issue from the template.
	2.	Teams execute tasks: Work via issues/PRs; CI required.
	3.	Team signals readiness: Comment /ready wave-1.
	4.	Bot validates: If valid, flips team to ready in canonical JSON and posts ack.
	5.	All ready ‚Üí transition: Bot announces, flips Wave Gate check to ‚úÖ, and (optionally) opens/assigns next-wave tasks.

‚∏ª

10) User Stories, Acceptance, DoD, Tests

Each story has Acceptance Criteria (AC), Definition of Done (DoD), and a Test Plan that directly validates the AC.

‚∏ª

US-01 ‚Äî Team signals readiness via slash command

As a team member
I want to declare my team ready for a wave via /ready wave-n
So that coordination is fast, validated, and auditable.

AC
	‚Ä¢	AC1: /ready wave-n can only be issued by a member of that team.
	‚Ä¢	AC2: Bot validates all of the team‚Äôs wave:n tasks are closed via merged PRs (not manual close).
	‚Ä¢	AC3: All required checks on those PRs conclude success (or allowed neutral).
	‚Ä¢	AC4: On success, bot updates canonical JSON to status:"ready" with at (UTC) and task list; posts ack comment.
	‚Ä¢	AC5: On failure, bot posts a concise failure reason and does not mark ready.

DoD
	‚Ä¢	Team member invokes command; bot responds in < 60s.
	‚Ä¢	JSON block updated exactly once, no duplicates.
	‚Ä¢	Event logged in Actions logs.

Test Plan
	‚Ä¢	Unit: command parser (happy path, whitespace, casing).
	‚Ä¢	Integration: mock GH API shows issues closed via merged PR; bot flips to ready.
	‚Ä¢	Negative: manual issue closure ‚Üí bot rejects; failing check ‚Üí rejects.
	‚Ä¢	Security: non-member attempts /ready ‚Üí rejected.

‚∏ª

US-02 ‚Äî Team declares block / unready

As a team member
I want to mark us blocked (with reason) or back to in_progress
So that the coordinator sees reality.

AC
	‚Ä¢	AC1: /blocked reason:"..." updates JSON status:"blocked" + reason + time.
	‚Ä¢	AC2: /unready updates JSON status:"in_progress".
	‚Ä¢	AC3: Bot posts minimal ack comment.
	‚Ä¢	AC4: Only authorized team members may issue.

DoD
	‚Ä¢	Status flips reflected in JSON within 60s.
	‚Ä¢	Prior ready timestamps preserved in history log (optional).

Test Plan
	‚Ä¢	Unit: reason parser supports quotes + escaped chars.
	‚Ä¢	Integration: blocked ‚Üí unready ‚Üí ready cycle works; JSON consistent.

‚∏ª

US-03 ‚Äî Canonical state maintained in a single pinned block

As a coordinator
I want machine-readable state in a single place
So that dashboards and humans see the same truth.

AC
	‚Ä¢	AC1: JSON lives in a fenced block delimited by markers: <!-- wave-state:DO-NOT-EDIT --> ... <!-- /wave-state -->.
	‚Ä¢	AC2: Only the bot edits this block.
	‚Ä¢	AC3: JSON validates against schema (wave, teams, statuses).
	‚Ä¢	AC4: Every edit updates updated_at (UTC).

DoD
	‚Ä¢	Schema file exists; linter validates JSON on CI (optional pre-commit).
	‚Ä¢	Editing preserves other body content.

Test Plan
	‚Ä¢	Unit: idempotent editor updates fields without clobbering.
	‚Ä¢	Property: multiple updates produce stable JSON (no reordering noise).

‚∏ª

US-04 ‚Äî All-ready gate + wave transition

As a coordinator
I want the system to announce transition when all teams ready
So that everyone moves together.

AC
	‚Ä¢	AC1: When every team in tasks.yaml for wave n is "ready", bot posts transition comment tagging teams.
	‚Ä¢	AC2: Bot creates/updates a Check Run named Wave Gate: Wave n to success.
	‚Ä¢	AC3: (Optional) Bot opens/assigns next-wave task issues per tasks.yaml.

DoD
	‚Ä¢	Transition is atomic; no double-announcements.
	‚Ä¢	Check-run visible in repo checks tab.

Test Plan
	‚Ä¢	Integration: final team /ready triggers announcement and check-run.
	‚Ä¢	Race: two teams ready within <5s ‚Üí single announcement (use GH Action concurrency group).

‚∏ª

US-05 ‚Äî Validation rules are strict and auditable

As a reviewer
I want confidence that ready means ‚Äúdone-done.‚Äù

AC
	‚Ä¢	AC1: Each task is closed by merged PR that references the issue via ‚ÄúCloses #‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	AC2: Required status checks conclude success (include OS matrix).
	‚Ä¢	AC3: (Optional) Coverage threshold per task met.
	‚Ä¢	AC4: (Optional) Files changed include docs for doc-required tasks.

DoD
	‚Ä¢	Validation logic covered by unit tests; rules documented.
	‚Ä¢	Failure messages include direct links to offending PR/check.

Test Plan
	‚Ä¢	Negative: PR merged without ‚ÄúCloses #‚Äù ‚Üí task remains open ‚Üí reject.
	‚Ä¢	Negative: CI partial green with one failed job ‚Üí reject.
	‚Ä¢	Positive: all pass ‚Üí accept.

‚∏ª

US-06 ‚Äî Permissions and identity

As a security owner
I want least-privilege automation and clear authN.

AC
	‚Ä¢	AC1: GitHub App token used (not user PAT).
	‚Ä¢	AC2: Teams and members defined in .github/wave/teams.yaml and aligned with CODEOWNERS.
	‚Ä¢	AC3: Only team members can change their team state.

DoD
	‚Ä¢	App installed org-wide with documented permissions.
	‚Ä¢	Attempt by non-member rejected.

Test Plan
	‚Ä¢	Integration: simulate actor not in team ‚Üí 403-style rejection path.

‚∏ª

US-07 ‚Äî Rate-limit & retry resilience

As a platform owner
I want the coordinator to be resilient to API hiccups.

AC
	‚Ä¢	AC1: Exponential backoff on 403 rate-limit, respect X-RateLimit-Reset.
	‚Ä¢	AC2: Retries on 5xx.
	‚Ä¢	AC3: Idempotency keys / deterministic updates avoid duplicate comments.

DoD
	‚Ä¢	Backoff helper with tests; logs include retry counts.

Test Plan
	‚Ä¢	Fault-injection: mock 403/5xx ‚Üí validate retries/backoff.

‚∏ª

US-08 ‚Äî Observability & metrics

As a PM
I want simple metrics without building Grafana.

AC
	‚Ä¢	AC1: Bot emits a compact metrics JSON artifact per run (wave, team, state, durations).
	‚Ä¢	AC2: Nightly job writes a rollup JSON to a branch (data/waves.json) or gh-pages.

DoD
	‚Ä¢	Metrics sane under load; timestamps in UTC.

Test Plan
	‚Ä¢	Integration: generate rollup with three teams over two waves; numbers correct.

‚∏ª

US-09 ‚Äî Task integrity from tasks.yaml

As a coordinator
I want one place to edit task ownership and wave mapping.

AC
	‚Ä¢	AC1: tasks.yaml drives labels (wave:n, team:name) and validation.
	‚Ä¢	AC2: A generator can (re)sync labels and issue fields from yaml.
	‚Ä¢	AC3: CI fails if a PR references a non-existent task_id.

DoD
	‚Ä¢	Generator script present; dry-run and apply modes.

Test Plan
	‚Ä¢	Unit: parse YAML; Integration: label sync updates issues.

‚∏ª

US-10 ‚Äî Runbook & failure recovery

As a human oncall
I want clear steps when things go sideways.

AC
	‚Ä¢	AC1: Runbook includes: stuck CI, manual close misuse, race during transition.
	‚Ä¢	AC2: /unready path documented for rollback.

DoD
	‚Ä¢	Runbook checked in at .github/wave/RUNBOOK.md.

Test Plan
	‚Ä¢	Table-top: simulate manual close ‚Üí recovery path works (reopen issue, fix PR, re-ready).

‚∏ª

11) Definition of Done (Global)
	‚Ä¢	All user stories‚Äô AC satisfied with passing tests.
	‚Ä¢	GitHub App installed with documented scopes.
	‚Ä¢	Actions configured with concurrency (e.g., group: wave-coordinator, cancel-in-progress: true).
	‚Ä¢	Branch protections enforced; PR template requires Task ID + ‚ÄúCloses #‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Sample plan (tasks.yaml) and three demo teams seeded; dry-run E2E passes.

‚∏ª

12) Test Strategy (End-to-End)
	‚Ä¢	Happy path: Three teams complete Wave 1 tasks ‚Üí /ready x3 ‚Üí transition posted ‚Üí Wave Gate check success ‚Üí Wave 2 issues assigned.
	‚Ä¢	CI fail path: One team PR has failing job ‚Üí /ready rejected with link to failing check.
	‚Ä¢	Auth path: Non-member tries /ready ‚Üí rejected.
	‚Ä¢	Race path: Two /ready comments within 2s ‚Üí one transition comment.
	‚Ä¢	Manual close misuse: Issue closed manually ‚Üí validator detects closedBy not PR ‚Üí rejected; runbook executed to reopen and fix.

‚∏ª

14) Operations Runbook (abridged)
	‚Ä¢	Team stuck in CI: Team comments /blocked reason:"CI flake on macOS runners"; infra assists; after fix, /unready then /ready.
	‚Ä¢	PR merged without ‚ÄúCloses #‚Äù: Reopen issue; push follow-up PR with proper closure; re-ready.
	‚Ä¢	Bot rate-limited: Action retries. If still failing, maintainer manually reruns workflow.
	‚Ä¢	Rollback readiness: Team uses /unready. Bot flips state; transition remains pending.

‚∏ª

15) Rollout Plan
	1.	Week 0: Install GitHub App; add branch protections; seed labels; commit templates; land tasks.yaml.
	2.	Week 1: Enable wave-coordinator.yml; dry-run on a demo wave with 2-3 toy tasks per team.
	3.	Week 2: Pilot on a real wave; observe; tweak validation rules (coverage/doc rules).
	4.	Week 3+: Make it the standard; kill status meetings; keep sync points.
