# Problem Statement: Claude Auto-Tee Implementation Analysis & Tech Spec Development

## Context and Background

The claude-auto-tee project was developed following a structured expert debate on programming language selection (found at `docs/debates/programming-language`). However, the final implementation diverges significantly from user expectations and expert recommendations:

### Current Implementation Reality
1. **Dual Implementation**: Both JavaScript (`src/hook.js`) and Rust (`src/*.rs`) implementations exist
2. **Hybrid Activation Strategy**: Both use pattern matching + pipe detection despite expert consensus for pipe-only
3. **Implementation Drift**: Critical gap between expert-recommended design and actual code (documented in `docs/drift.md`)
4. **Performance Issues**: 165x performance degradation maintained despite expert warnings
5. **Security Vulnerabilities**: DoS attack surface through pattern matching complexity
6. **Feature Bloat**: Complex activation logic contradicts "quick and dirty" tool requirements

### User's Core Need (Revealed)
> "This is meant to be a small 'quick and dirty' tool that just helps Claude quickly look up the output from the last command he ran, so that when he greps build output, for example, and it misses, he doesn't have to run the build a second time (or other scenarios where the command might not produce the same output each time). Primary goal here is to save time and tokens."

### The Fundamental Mismatch
The current implementations are **over-engineered solutions** that contradict the user's actual need:
- **User wants**: Simple output saving for command re-examination
- **Current reality**: Complex activation strategies, pattern databases, AST parsing
- **Result**: Implementation drift from core requirements

## Specific Decision Points

### 1. Implementation Evaluation
- What are the merits of existing JavaScript vs Rust implementations?
- What fundamental shortcomings exist in both approaches?
- How do current implementations fail to meet the core "quick and dirty" requirement?

### 2. Feature Scope Definition  
- What is the minimal viable feature set that meets user needs?
- Should activation be simple, predictable, and universal rather than complex?
- What functionality is essential vs unnecessary complexity?

### 3. Technical Architecture
- What is the simplest architecture that solves the core problem?
- Should we prioritize simplicity over performance optimization?
- How can we prevent future implementation drift from requirements?

### 4. User Story Definition
- What are the core user scenarios that must be supported?
- What are the acceptance criteria for each user story?
- How do we define "done" to prevent feature creep?

## Success Criteria

The debate must produce a **comprehensive tech spec document** that:

1. **Analyzes Current Implementations**
   - Honest assessment of merits and fatal flaws
   - Clear identification of over-engineering vs user needs
   - Specific shortcomings that must be addressed

2. **Defines Core Requirements**
   - User stories with clear acceptance criteria and definitions of done
   - Minimal viable feature set aligned with "quick and dirty" goal
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, maintainability)

3. **Provides Implementation Guidance**
   - Technical architecture that prevents drift
   - Clear boundaries on scope and complexity
   - Implementation checklist to ensure requirements compliance

4. **Establishes Quality Gates**
   - Requirements traceability from user need to implementation
   - Testing strategy focused on core scenarios
   - Review criteria to prevent future over-engineering

## Constraints and Requirements

### Core Constraint: Simplicity First
- "Quick and dirty" tool philosophy must be preserved
- Complexity should be justified by user value, not technical elegance
- Implementation should match user mental model of "save command output"

### Primary User Goal: Time and Token Savings
- Prevent re-running expensive commands (builds, tests, searches)
- Enable quick re-examination of command output
- Minimize cognitive overhead and activation complexity

### Anti-Requirements (What NOT to Build)
- Complex pattern matching databases
- Sophisticated activation strategies
- Performance micro-optimizations at expense of simplicity
- Feature-rich solutions that obscure core functionality

### Quality Requirements
- Zero implementation drift from agreed specifications
- Clear traceability from user story to code
- Simple testing and validation approach
- Maintainable architecture without over-engineering

## Expected Debate Outcome

A **Technical Specification Document** that Claude can use to rewrite this project with:

1. **Executive Summary**: Clear problem statement and solution approach
2. **User Stories**: With requirements, acceptance criteria, and definitions of done
3. **Feature Specification**: Minimal viable feature set with clear boundaries
4. **Technical Architecture**: Simple, drift-resistant design
5. **Implementation Guidance**: Step-by-step development approach
6. **Quality Assurance**: Testing strategy and acceptance criteria
7. **Review Checklist**: Gates to prevent over-engineering and drift

This spec must be **actionable, specific, and aligned with the core user need** of saving time and tokens through simple command output preservation.

## Key Questions for Expert Consideration

1. **Implementation Analysis**: Are both current implementations fundamentally flawed approaches to the user's actual need?
2. **Scope Definition**: What is the absolute minimum feature set that solves the core problem?
3. **Architecture Decision**: Should we prioritize radical simplicity over technical sophistication?
4. **User Experience**: How can activation be made predictable and aligned with user mental models?
5. **Quality Strategy**: How do we prevent future implementation drift and over-engineering?

The debate should result in a clear, implementable specification that Claude can follow to build exactly what the user needs - no more, no less.
