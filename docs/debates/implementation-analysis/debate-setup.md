# Debate Setup: Claude Auto-Tee Implementation Analysis & Tech Spec Development

## Expert Assignments

- **Expert 001**: dx-optimizer - Developer Experience and tool usability specialist
- **Expert 002**: architect-reviewer - Technical architecture and complexity analysis expert  
- **Expert 003**: business-analyst - Requirements analysis and user story definition specialist
- **Expert 004**: backend-architect - System design and implementation strategy expert
- **Expert 005**: debugger - Implementation analysis and technical debt assessment specialist

## Debate Order
Randomized presentation order: Expert 003, Expert 001, Expert 005, Expert 002, Expert 004

## Rules
- Experts identify only by number (001, 002, etc.) during debate
- Domain expertise revealed only in this setup document
- Arguments evaluated on merit, not authority
- Focus on user needs over technical preferences
- Prioritize simplicity and requirement alignment over sophisticated solutions

## Expert Domains

### Expert 001 (dx-optimizer)
- **Primary Focus**: Developer experience, tool adoption, and usability
- **Key Concerns**: How tools integrate into workflows, cognitive overhead, learning curves
- **Perspective**: "Tools should feel invisible and solve real problems without creating new ones"

### Expert 002 (architect-reviewer) 
- **Primary Focus**: Technical architecture, design patterns, and complexity management
- **Key Concerns**: Maintainability, extensibility, technical debt, and architectural drift
- **Perspective**: "Architecture should serve user needs, not demonstrate technical sophistication"

### Expert 003 (business-analyst)
- **Primary Focus**: Requirements analysis, user story definition, and business value alignment
- **Key Concerns**: Clear requirements, measurable outcomes, and user value delivery
- **Perspective**: "Every feature must trace back to a specific user need with measurable value"

### Expert 004 (backend-architect)
- **Primary Focus**: Implementation strategy, system design, and technical execution
- **Key Concerns**: Implementation feasibility, technology choices, and system boundaries
- **Perspective**: "The best implementation is the simplest one that reliably solves the problem"

### Expert 005 (debugger)
- **Primary Focus**: Problem diagnosis, technical analysis, and implementation assessment
- **Key Concerns**: Root cause identification, technical debt analysis, and solution validation
- **Perspective**: "Understanding what went wrong is essential to getting it right"

## Debate Focus Areas

### Phase 1: Current Implementation Analysis
- Merits and fatal flaws of existing JavaScript and Rust implementations
- Assessment of implementation drift from user needs
- Technical debt and over-engineering analysis

### Phase 2: Requirements Clarification  
- User story development with clear acceptance criteria
- Feature scope definition aligned with "quick and dirty" philosophy
- Anti-requirements identification (what NOT to build)

### Phase 3: Technical Specification Development
- Architecture decisions prioritizing simplicity
- Implementation guidance and quality gates
- Drift prevention mechanisms

## Success Metrics

The debate succeeds if it produces:
1. **Clear Implementation Assessment**: Honest evaluation of current approaches
2. **Minimal Viable Requirements**: User stories focused on core value delivery
3. **Simple Technical Specification**: Architecture that prevents over-engineering
4. **Actionable Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step guidance Claude can follow
5. **Quality Assurance Strategy**: Tests and reviews that ensure requirement compliance

## Context Requirements

All experts must consider:
- User's explicit need: "quick and dirty tool for command output re-examination"
- Primary goal: "save time and tokens"
- Current problem: Over-engineered solutions that don't match user expectations
- Implementation drift: Gap between expert consensus and actual code
- Anti-pattern: Complex activation strategies for simple output saving need
