# Expert 003 Opening Statement: Requirements Analysis & Business Value Alignment

## Executive Summary

The claude-auto-tee project exhibits a classic case of **over-engineering driven by assumptions rather than user needs**. Both implementations (JavaScript and Rust) have strayed significantly from the core user requirement: a simple tool to save command output for quick retrieval.

## Requirements Gap Analysis

### Stated User Need
- **Primary Goal**: Save time and tokens by avoiding re-running commands
- **Use Case**: Quick lookup of last command output when initial analysis (grep, etc.) fails
- **Scope**: "Small, quick and dirty tool"
- **Value**: Prevent duplicate expensive operations (builds, tests, API calls)

### Current Implementation Gaps

| User Expectation | JS Implementation | Rust Implementation | Gap Severity |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Simple activation | Complex pattern matching | Sophisticated rule engine | **HIGH** |
| Quick retrieval | Database persistence | Multi-criteria analysis | **HIGH** |
| Minimal overhead | Heavy dependency chain | Complex state management | **MEDIUM** |
| "Quick and dirty" | Production-ready architecture | Enterprise-grade logging | **HIGH** |

## Business Value Impact

### Current State: Negative ROI
- **Development Effort**: 10x more complex than needed
- **Maintenance Burden**: Database schemas, rule engines, pattern matching
- **User Adoption Risk**: Cognitive overhead exceeds utility
- **Time to Value**: Extended due to unnecessary complexity

### Target State: Positive ROI
- **Implementation Time**: 2-4 hours vs current 20+ hours
- **Maintenance**: Zero ongoing complexity
- **User Experience**: Instant utility, no learning curve
- **Token Savings**: Immediate 50-90% reduction in re-run scenarios

## User Story Decomposition

### Epic: Command Output Preservation
**As** Claude (AI assistant)  
**I want** to quickly access the output from my last command  
**So that** I don't waste time and tokens re-running expensive operations

### Core User Stories

1. **Output Capture**
   - **As** Claude, **I want** all command outputs automatically saved
   - **So that** they're available for immediate retrieval
   - **Acceptance**: Every bash command output is preserved

2. **Quick Retrieval**
   - **As** Claude, **I want** to retrieve the last command's output with a simple command
   - **So that** I can analyze it without re-execution
   - **Acceptance**: Single command returns last output in <2 seconds

3. **Context Preservation**
   - **As** Claude, **I want** to see what command produced the output
   - **So that** I understand the context
   - **Acceptance**: Output includes original command for reference

### Anti-Stories (What Users DON'T Want)
- Complex configuration or setup
- Pattern matching or rule definition
- Database management
- Multiple activation strategies
- Enterprise-grade logging

## Proposed Voting Options

### Option A: Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
- Single shell hook that saves last command + output
- Simple retrieval mechanism (`last-output` or similar)
- No persistence beyond session
- **Effort**: 2-4 hours | **Value**: Immediate utility

### Option B: Enhanced Simple Solution  
- Session-based persistence (temp files)
- Last N commands with simple indexing
- Basic cleanup on session end
- **Effort**: 4-8 hours | **Value**: Covers edge cases

### Option C: Refactor Current Implementation
- Strip complex features from existing code
- Simplify to core functionality
- Maintain some architectural elements
- **Effort**: 8-16 hours | **Value**: Leverages existing work

### Option D: Requirements Gathering Phase
- Interview user for additional unstated needs
- Prototype multiple approaches
- Build comprehensive requirements document
- **Effort**: 16+ hours | **Value**: Risk mitigation but delays delivery

## Recommended Path Forward

**Vote: Option A (MVP)**

### Rationale
1. **Fastest Time to Value**: User gets utility immediately
2. **Requirements Validation**: Can test actual usage patterns
3. **Iteration Base**: Simple foundation for future enhancement
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Low complexity reduces failure modes

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: User begins using tool within 24 hours
- **Token Savings**: Measurable reduction in duplicate command execution
- **Satisfaction**: User reports positive utility without friction
- **Maintenance**: Zero ongoing maintenance required

## Implementation Principle

> "The best requirement is the one that delivers user value with the least complexity. Every feature beyond the core need is technical debt until proven otherwise by actual usage data."
