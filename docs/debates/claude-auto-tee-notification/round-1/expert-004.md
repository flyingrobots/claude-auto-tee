# Expert 004: Round 1 Response - API Contract and System Boundaries

## My Perspective

Having reviewed all opening statements, I see convergence around structured communication but divergence on implementation complexity. As a backend systems architect, I must emphasize that **simplicity and reliability are not opposing forces** - they're mutually reinforcing design principles.

### Critical Architecture Insights from Other Experts

Expert 001's registry pattern shows solid architectural thinking but introduces unnecessary complexity for the core use case. Expert 002's environment variable approach aligns with my thinking but lacks the structured metadata needed for operational reliability. Expert 003's multi-channel strategy addresses LLM attention patterns but risks implementation bloat. Expert 005's operational focus correctly identifies the observability gap but their solutions introduce platform-specific dependencies.

### Refined Architectural Position

The solution must satisfy these **non-negotiable system requirements**:

1. **Deterministic Communication**: Claude must receive capture status through a guaranteed channel
2. **Zero Parse Ambiguity**: No regex parsing, no string extraction, no inference required
3. **Platform Invariant**: Identical behavior across Unix/Windows/MacOS
4. **Atomic Operations**: Either capture succeeds completely or fails cleanly
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing workflows unaffected

### Proposed: Minimal Structured Protocol

I propose a **three-line modification** to the current approach that satisfies all requirements:

```bash
# Replace current stderr message with:
echo "CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_STATUS=SUCCESS" >&2
echo "CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_FILE=/tmp/claude-xyz.log" >&2  
echo "CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_SIZE=$(wc -c < /tmp/claude-xyz.log)" >&2
```

This creates a **predictable, parseable protocol** without JSON complexity or environment variable pollution. Claude can reliably detect these three lines and extract the file path with zero ambiguity.

### Why This Beats All Alternatives

**vs Registry Pattern**: No persistent state, no cleanup, no cross-session complexity
**vs Environment Variables**: No shell environment pollution, works in all subprocess contexts
**vs JSON Wrappers**: No parsing complexity, no stdout modification, preserves command semantics
**vs Exit Codes**: No semantic conflicts with wrapped command exit codes

The protocol provides structured data while maintaining the current architecture's simplicity. It's **evolutionarily stable** - can be enhanced later without breaking existing implementations.

### Service Boundary Clarification

This establishes a clean **contract interface**:

**Tool Contract**: 
- Emit exactly three CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_* lines to stderr on successful capture
- Emit CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_STATUS=FAILURE on capture failure
- Guarantee absolute paths in CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_FILE

**Claude Contract**:
- Parse stderr for CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_STATUS lines
- Use file path from CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_FILE when STATUS=SUCCESS
- Fall back to normal behavior when STATUS=FAILURE or missing

This creates **loose coupling** with **strong contracts** - the hallmark of reliable distributed systems.

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: NO

**Reason**: All experts converge on structured communication need. The implementation details can be resolved through prototype evaluation rather than further theoretical debate. We have sufficient architectural clarity to move to concrete implementation comparison.

## Proposed Voting Options

1. **Three-Line Protocol** (My recommendation): Structured stderr with CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_* prefixes
2. **Environment Variable Bridge**: Export CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_CAPTURE with structured data
3. **Minimal JSON Metadata**: Single-line JSON object in stderr with capture details
4. **Hybrid Signal**: Combine environment variable for reliability with stderr for visibility

The debate should conclude with prototype implementations of these four approaches, measuring actual Claude awareness rates across different command scenarios.
