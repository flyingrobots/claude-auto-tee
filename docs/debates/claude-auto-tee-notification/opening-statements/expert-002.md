## Analysis of Current State

The claude-auto-tee tool successfully captures full output to temporary files, but the notification mechanism relies on stderr messages that Claude may miss or fail to parse reliably. This creates a critical friction point that undermines the tool's core value proposition of avoiding command re-runs.

Current notification approach:
```bash
echo "Full output saved to: /tmp/claude-xyz.log" >&2
```

This approach has several DX problems:
1. **Signal-to-noise ratio**: Message may be lost among other stderr output
2. **Parsing complexity**: Requires Claude to extract file paths from unstructured text
3. **Memory burden**: Claude must remember paths across tool invocations
4. **Discovery gap**: No mechanism to list or discover available captures

## DX-Optimized Solution Framework

From a developer experience perspective, the ideal solution should be **invisible when it works and obvious when it doesn't**. The notification mechanism should require zero cognitive overhead from Claude while providing 100% reliability.

### Core DX Principles Applied

1. **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Eliminate need for Claude to parse, remember, or discover paths
2. **Make Success States Obvious**: Clear, unambiguous signals when capture succeeds
3. **Fail Gracefully**: Degrade predictably when things go wrong
4. **Minimize Context Switching**: Keep all information in a single, consistent location

### Recommended Approach: Structured Environment Injection

**Mechanism**: Inject structured capture metadata directly into the command environment via a predictable environment variable.

**Implementation**:
```bash
# In claude-auto-tee.sh, set environment variable with structured data
export CLAUDE_CAPTURES='[{"id":"20241213_143052_abc123","path":"/tmp/claude-20241213_143052_abc123.log","command":"npm test | head -10","size":51200,"timestamp":1702477852}]'

# Modified command execution
CLAUDE_CAPTURES="$CLAUDE_CAPTURES" eval "$modified_command"
```

**Claude Integration**: Claude Code hooks automatically read `CLAUDE_CAPTURES` environment variable and display structured summary.

### Key Advantages

1. **Zero Parsing Required**: Structured JSON data eliminates text parsing
2. **Automatic Discovery**: Claude can list all available captures without user intervention  
3. **Rich Metadata**: Size, timestamp, original command context included
4. **Backwards Compatible**: Existing workflows unaffected
5. **Cross-Platform**: Environment variables work consistently across all platforms
6. **Stateless**: No persistent files or complex state management required

### Implementation Details

**Environment Variable Structure**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "unique_capture_id",
    "path": "/absolute/path/to/capture.log", 
    "command": "original command that was captured",
    "size": 51200,
    "timestamp": 1702477852,
    "status": "success|failed|partial"
  }
]
```

**Hook Enhancement**: Extend pre-tool-use hook to:
1. Read `CLAUDE_CAPTURES` environment variable
2. Display summary of available captures when present
3. Provide structured retrieval commands

**Example Output**:
```
üìÅ Available Captures (2):
  1. npm test | head -10 ‚Üí /tmp/claude-abc123.log (50KB)
  2. docker logs app ‚Üí /tmp/claude-def456.log (2MB)

To retrieve: cat /tmp/claude-abc123.log
```

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Capture Registry File
**Mechanism**: Maintain `~/.claude-auto-tee/captures.json` registry
**Pros**: Persistent across sessions, rich metadata
**Cons**: File I/O overhead, cleanup complexity, cross-platform path issues

### 2. Special Exit Codes + stderr Markers
**Mechanism**: Use special exit code (e.g., 201) + structured stderr
**Pros**: No environment pollution
**Cons**: Still requires stderr parsing, breaks command semantics

### 3. Notification Sidecar Files
**Mechanism**: Create `.notification` files alongside captures
**Pros**: Self-contained, discoverable
**Cons**: Directory pollution, cleanup overhead

## Proposed Voting Options

1. **Environment Variable Injection** (Recommended)
   - Inject CLAUDE_CAPTURES environment variable with structured JSON
   - Extend pre-tool-use hook to display capture summaries
   - Zero-parsing solution with rich metadata

2. **Capture Registry with Hook Integration**
   - Maintain persistent JSON registry file
   - Hook automatically displays and cleans registry
   - Better for long-term capture management

3. **Enhanced stderr with Structured Markers**
   - Improve current stderr approach with structured markers
   - Add hook-based parsing and display
   - Minimal change to current implementation

4. **Hybrid Notification Strategy**
   - Combine environment variables for immediate captures
   - Registry file for cross-session persistence
   - Provides both immediate awareness and historical tracking

## Success Criteria Alignment

‚úÖ **100% Awareness**: Environment variable ensures Claude always sees capture data  
‚úÖ **Easy Retrieval**: Absolute paths provided directly, no discovery needed  
‚úÖ **Pre-tool-use Compatible**: Works within existing hook architecture  
‚úÖ **Low Overhead**: Minimal performance impact, simple implementation  
‚úÖ **Unambiguous Signals**: Structured JSON eliminates parsing ambiguity  

The environment variable approach optimizes for the primary use case (immediate capture awareness) while maintaining simplicity and reliability - hallmarks of excellent developer experience.
