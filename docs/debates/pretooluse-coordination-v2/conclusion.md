## Results

### Vote Table

| Expert ID | Selection | Confidence | Primary Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Expert 001 | Option A | 4/5 | Security mitigable through atomic reservation; existing infrastructure supports enhancement |
| Expert 002 | Option C | 4/5 | Token coordination provides 100% reliability vs 99% prediction accuracy |
| Expert 003 | Option B | 4/5 | Architectural integrity trumps marginal performance gains |
| Expert 004 | Option D | 4/5 | Hybrid approach with fallback maintains reliability while enabling optimization |
| Expert 005 | Option B | 4/5 | Security attack surface reduction eliminates TOCTOU vulnerabilities |

### Winner: Option B - No Path Prediction, PostToolUse Only

**Vote Distribution:**
- Option B: 2 votes (Experts 003, 005)
- Option A: 1 vote (Expert 001)
- Option C: 1 vote (Expert 002)
- Option D: 1 vote (Expert 004)

### Majority Rationale Themes

The experts who voted against path prediction (Options B and C, representing 3/5 majority when considering both approaches eliminate prediction) converged on several key themes:

1. **Architectural Simplicity**: Path prediction creates unnecessary coupling between PreToolUse and PostToolUse phases, violating separation of concerns
2. **Security Integrity**: Eliminating prediction removes TOCTOU vulnerabilities and race condition attack surfaces
3. **Reliability Over Optimization**: 100% reliability achievable without prediction outweighs marginal 1-2ms performance gains
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Existing cleanup mechanisms prove prediction failures are frequent enough to indicate architectural fragility

### Minority Rationale Themes

The experts supporting prediction (Options A and D) emphasized:

1. **Performance Compounding**: Millisecond gains accumulate across thousands of daily executions
2. **User Experience**: Path visibility enables better error handling and debugging workflows
3. **Mitigation Strategies**: Security concerns addressable through atomic file reservation
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Hybrid approaches can fall back when prediction fails

### Recommended Implementation

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Remove path prediction logic from PreToolUse hooks
2. Implement token-based correlation between PreToolUse and PostToolUse
3. Simplify PostToolUse to handle path generation directly
4. Remove `clean_concurrent_path()` and related recovery mechanisms

**Rollout Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1** (Week 1): Implement core changes in feature branch
2. **Phase 2** (Week 2): Extensive testing with existing hook ecosystem
3. **Phase 3** (Week 3): Gradual rollout with feature flag (10% → 50% → 100%)
4. **Phase 4** (Week 4): Remove deprecated prediction code paths

**Monitoring Signals:**
- Hook execution latency (expect <2ms increase)
- Hook failure rates (should decrease without prediction mismatches)
- Token correlation success rate (target 100%)
- Security scan results for TOCTOU vulnerabilities

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance Regression**: Monitor p99 latencies; if degradation exceeds 5ms, investigate token overhead
2. **Hook Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility layer for 30 days
3. **Correlation Failures**: Implement robust token generation with collision detection
4. **Documentation Debt**: Update all hook documentation before rollout

### Decision Rationale

While Option B received only 2 direct votes, the philosophical alignment between Options B and C (both eliminating prediction) represents the true majority position. The debate revealed that architectural integrity and security considerations outweigh marginal performance optimizations, especially when those optimizations introduce systematic brittleness requiring dedicated recovery mechanisms.

The decision to implement Option B over Option C reflects the minimal additional complexity of token-based coordination while preserving the core benefit of eliminating path prediction entirely.
