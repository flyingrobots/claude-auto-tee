# Final Position: Security-First Token-Only Coordination

After reviewing all arguments, I maintain that **PreToolUse hooks should NOT include predicted capture paths** due to fundamental security and architectural concerns that outweigh performance benefits.

**My Final Stance:**
Token-only coordination eliminates the temporal attack window inherent in path prediction while providing identical functionality. The existing cleanup mechanisms (`clean_concurrent_path()`) prove prediction failures occur frequently enough to require dedicated recovery - this complexity indicates architectural fragility, not robustness.

**Best Steelman of Opposition:**
The strongest opposing argument comes from the performance optimization perspective: path prediction enables early resource allocation and security validation. This is compelling because PreToolUse resource preparation is indeed valuable. However, this benefit can be achieved through token-based resource reservation without the prediction accuracy risks.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
Concrete evidence that path prediction accuracy can achieve 100% reliability across all target platforms under high concurrency, OR mathematical proof that the performance gains from early resource allocation justify the security complexity. Currently, the 1% failure rate multiplied across thousands of executions creates unacceptable operational overhead.

**Current Conviction:**
Security systems should validate reality, not predictions. The TOCTOU vulnerabilities and race conditions are not theoretical - they represent genuine attack vectors that sophisticated adversaries will exploit. Token-based coordination provides equivalent coordination capabilities without expanding the attack surface.
