# Final Statement: Architectural Integrity Over Convenience

**Position**: PreToolUse hooks should NOT include predicted capture paths. Token-based coordination maintains architectural integrity while enabling necessary coordination.

Throughout this debate, the fundamental tension has remained between implementation convenience and architectural soundness. While advocates for path prediction cite existing implementations and marginal performance benefits, these arguments miss the broader system design implications.

**My Final Position**: The coupling introduced by path prediction violates core architectural principles. PreToolUse hooks should focus on notification and preparation, not path generation. This separation of concerns isn't theoretical dogma - it's practical engineering that prevents the security vulnerabilities and maintenance debt identified by other experts.

**Strongest Opposing Argument**: The user experience benefits are real. Knowing capture paths beforehand does enable better context preparation and error handling. However, token-based coordination delivers these same benefits through loose coupling rather than tight prediction dependencies.

**What Would Change My Mind**: Evidence that path prediction can be implemented with true separation of concerns - perhaps through abstract interfaces that completely decouple prediction logic from both hook phases. Current proposals still create concrete dependencies between PreToolUse and PostToolUse components.

Token-based coordination represents architectural discipline: achieving functional requirements while preserving system modularity. The microsecond performance differences pale compared to long-term maintainability benefits.

**Current Stance**: Choose architectural integrity. Future system evolution depends on maintaining clean boundaries between components, not optimizing current convenience at the cost of future flexibility.
