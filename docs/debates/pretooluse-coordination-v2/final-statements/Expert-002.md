# Final Statement: Token Coordination Remains the Superior Choice

**My Position**: PreToolUse hooks should use token-based coordination WITHOUT predicted capture paths.

After two rounds of debate, my conviction has strengthened. Expert 001's defense of path prediction relies on performance claims that don't withstand scrutiny - 2ms savings don't justify architectural complexity. Expert 003's coupling arguments align perfectly with my reliability concerns: prediction creates brittle dependencies that tokens elegantly avoid.

**The Core Issue**: Production systems cannot tolerate "99% accuracy" when 100% reliability is achievable. Expert 001's dismissal of the 1% failure rate ignores compound effects across thousands of daily executions. The existing `clean_concurrent_path()` cleanup mechanisms prove prediction failures occur frequently enough to require dedicated recovery logic.

**Best Steelman of Opposition**: Expert 001 correctly identifies that existing implementations already perform path prediction, making token-only coordination a departure from proven patterns. The security validation benefits of early path knowledge have merit for preventing injection attacks before execution begins.

**What Would Change My Mind**: Evidence that path prediction achieves genuine 100% accuracy across all platforms and concurrent scenarios, or demonstration that token coordination introduces failure modes more severe than prediction mismatches.

Token coordination remains architecturally superior: it provides identical correlation benefits with zero prediction brittleness, maintains loose coupling between hooks, and eliminates the entire prediction-validation cycle. This is optimization through simplification, not compromise.
