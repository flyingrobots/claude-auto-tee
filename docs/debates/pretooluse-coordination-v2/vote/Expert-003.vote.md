# Vote: Option B - No Path Prediction, PostToolUse Only

After analyzing all expert positions, I vote for **Option B** with high confidence.

The architectural analysis reveals that path prediction fundamentally violates separation of concerns by creating tight coupling between PreToolUse and PostToolUse phases. While performance arguments cite 1-2ms benefits, this optimization comes at severe architectural cost.

The security analysis from Expert 005 exposes genuine TOCTOU vulnerabilities that prediction creates. Expert 002's reliability concerns about 99% accuracy compound across thousands of executions. Expert 004's hybrid approach, while thoughtful, adds implementation complexity that contradicts architectural simplicity principles.

Token-based coordination delivers equivalent coordination capabilities while preserving clean component boundaries. The existing cleanup mechanisms (`clean_concurrent_path()`) prove prediction failures are frequent enough to require dedicated recovery logic - indicating architectural fragility rather than robustness.

Choosing architectural discipline over implementation convenience ensures long-term system maintainability and security. The microsecond performance differences are negligible compared to the architectural debt that path prediction introduces.
