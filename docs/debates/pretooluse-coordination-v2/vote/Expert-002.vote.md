# Vote: Token-Based Coordination Without Paths

**Selection**: Option C - Token-based coordination without paths

**Confidence**: 4/5

After reviewing all expert positions, the token-only approach represents the optimal balance of reliability, architectural integrity, and operational simplicity. The evidence from existing cleanup mechanisms demonstrates that path prediction failures occur frequently enough to require dedicated recovery logic, indicating systematic brittleness rather than edge-case handling.

The performance arguments for path prediction (1-2ms savings) don't justify the architectural complexity and failure modes introduced by prediction dependencies. Token-based coordination achieves identical correlation capabilities with zero prediction risk, maintaining clean separation of concerns between PreToolUse and PostToolUse phases.

This choice prioritizes long-term system reliability and maintainability over marginal performance optimizations that introduce operational overhead through compound failure effects.
