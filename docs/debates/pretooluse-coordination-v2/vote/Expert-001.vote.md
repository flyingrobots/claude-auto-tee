# Vote: Option A - Include predicted paths with specific coordination mechanism

After reviewing all final statements, I select **Option A** with confidence level 4.

The debate has clarified that while security and architectural concerns about path prediction are legitimate, they can be mitigated through proper implementation rather than abandonment. Expert 004's hybrid approach with atomic file reservation addresses the TOCTOU vulnerabilities raised by Expert 005, while Expert 002's token coordination provides the reliability mechanisms needed for production systems.

The key insight is that prediction accuracy isn't binary - the existing cleanup mechanisms prove the system already handles prediction failures gracefully. Rather than eliminating prediction entirely, we should enhance the coordination mechanism to make it more robust.

Option A represents the best balance between functional benefits and architectural integrity, particularly when implemented with the security enhancements proposed during the debate.
