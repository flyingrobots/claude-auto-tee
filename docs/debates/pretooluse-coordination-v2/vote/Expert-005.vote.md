# Vote: Option B - No Path Prediction, PostToolUse Only

After careful analysis of all expert positions, I vote for **Option B** with high confidence.

The security implications of path prediction fundamentally outweigh the marginal performance benefits. While Expert 001's hybrid approach and Expert 004's atomic reservation mitigation are technically sophisticated, they introduce implementation complexity that expands the attack surface.

Expert 002's reliability arguments align perfectly with security best practices - 99% accuracy in security-critical systems is insufficient when 100% reliability is achievable through simpler architecture. The existing `clean_concurrent_path()` mechanisms prove that prediction failures occur frequently enough to require dedicated recovery logic, indicating inherent architectural fragility.

Token-only coordination provides equivalent functional capabilities while maintaining security boundaries and architectural separation of concerns. This represents defense through simplification rather than compromise through complexity.
