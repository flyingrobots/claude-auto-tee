# Vote: Hybrid Approach with Optional Prediction

**Selection: D - Hybrid approach with optional prediction**

After analyzing all final statements, I vote for the hybrid approach because it addresses the core tensions between functionality, security, and architectural integrity that have emerged throughout this debate.

The security concerns raised are valid - TOCTOU vulnerabilities and race conditions represent genuine risks. However, these can be mitigated through atomic file reservation during PreToolUse execution, eliminating the temporal attack window while preserving the functional benefits of path prediction.

The architectural coupling concerns are also legitimate, but the hybrid approach provides a graceful degradation path: when prediction fails or security requirements prevent it, the system falls back to token-only coordination. This preserves architectural flexibility while enabling optimization when appropriate.

The performance benefits, while measured in milliseconds, compound across thousands of daily executions. More importantly, the user experience improvements from Claude understanding capture destinations enable better error handling and debugging workflows that pure token coordination cannot provide.
