# Research Log: Architectural Assessment of PreToolUse Coordination

## Research Queries

1. **Hook Architecture Analysis**: Examine current PreToolUse/PostToolUse implementation patterns
   ```bash
   grep -r "PreToolUse\|PostToolUse\|inject_.*marker" src/
   find . -name "*hook*" -o -name "*marker*" | head -10
   ```

2. **Coordination Mechanism Discovery**: Investigate existing inter-hook communication patterns
   ```bash
   grep -r "coordination\|state\|context\|shared" src/ docs/
   grep -r "token\|session\|uuid\|identifier" src/
   ```

3. **Path Prediction Architecture**: Analyze current capture path prediction and validation logic
   ```bash
   grep -r "predict.*path\|capture.*path" src/
   examine predict_capture_path() function in pretooluse-markers.sh
   ```

4. **Security Boundary Analysis**: Assess injection vectors and validation patterns in hook coordination
   ```bash
   grep -r "sanitiz\|validat\|clean.*path" src/
   analyze path normalization and security controls
   ```

## Expected Findings

- **Existing Hook Infrastructure**: Current PreToolUse implementation with path prediction capability
- **Limited Coordination**: Minimal shared state between pre/post hooks, creating architectural gaps
- **Security Validation**: Some path sanitization but potential gaps in prediction coordination
- **Performance Considerations**: Timestamp-based prediction with fallback mechanisms

## Key Takeaways

• **Architectural Coupling Risk**: PreToolUse predicted paths create tight coupling between hook phases, violating single responsibility principle and increasing system complexity

• **State Management Anti-Pattern**: Current architecture lacks proper inter-hook state coordination, leading to potential prediction-reality mismatches that violate architectural consistency

• **Security Boundary Violation**: Path prediction in PreToolUse bypasses PostToolUse validation boundaries, creating security inconsistencies across the hook lifecycle

• **SOLID Principle Violations**: Adding predicted paths violates Open/Closed Principle by requiring PostToolUse modifications for every PreToolUse prediction change

• **Architectural Simplicity**: Token-based coordination (Option C) maintains better separation of concerns while enabling hook communication without direct path coupling

## Citations

1. **Martin Fowler's "Refactoring"**: Coupling between components should be minimized - PreToolUse path prediction tightly couples hook phases
2. **Clean Architecture (Uncle Bob)**: Dependencies should flow inward - predicted paths create outward dependencies from PreToolUse to PostToolUse
3. **Gang of Four Design Patterns**: Observer pattern for loose coupling - token-based coordination follows this pattern better than direct path sharing
