# Research Log - PreToolUse Hooks and Predicted Capture Paths

## Research Queries

1. **Codebase Analysis**: Examine existing hook implementations and capture mechanisms
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" | xargs grep -l "hook\|capture\|PreToolUse\|PostToolUse"
   ```

2. **Security Vulnerability Patterns**: Search for command injection and path traversal vulnerabilities in hook coordination
   ```bash
   grep -r "eval\|exec\|system\|shell_exec" --include="*.sh" --include="*.js"
   ```

3. **Hook State Management**: Look for shared state or coordination mechanisms between pre/post hooks
   ```bash
   grep -r "state\|context\|shared\|coordinate" src/ docs/
   ```

4. **Error Handling Patterns**: Identify how hook failures cascade and affect tool execution
   ```bash
   grep -r "error\|fail\|exception\|throw" src/markers/ src/parser/
   ```

## Expected Findings

- **Existing Implementation**: Likely find basic hook structure but limited coordination mechanisms
- **Security Gaps**: Expect to find potential command injection vectors in path prediction logic
- **State Management**: Anticipate minimal shared state between pre/post hooks, creating coordination challenges
- **Error Propagation**: Likely inconsistent error handling between hook phases

## Key Takeaways

• **Security Risk**: Predicted capture paths introduce command injection vulnerabilities if not properly sanitized - paths from PreToolUse could be manipulated before PostToolUse validation

• **Race Conditions**: Without proper coordination, PreToolUse predictions and PostToolUse actual captures could create timing vulnerabilities where malicious content is written between hooks

• **State Isolation**: Current architecture likely lacks secure shared context between pre/post hooks, making path prediction coordination difficult to implement safely

• **Validation Gap**: PreToolUse predictions may bypass input validation that PostToolUse relies on, creating security inconsistencies

• **Error Surface**: Adding predicted paths increases the attack surface - more code paths mean more potential failure modes and security edge cases
