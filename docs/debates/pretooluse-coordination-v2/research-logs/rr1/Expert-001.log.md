# Research Log: PreToolUse Coordination Analysis

## Research Queries

1. **Codebase Analysis**: Examine existing hook implementations in `/src/` to understand current architecture
   - Query: `grep -r "PreToolUse\|PostToolUse\|hook" src/`
   - Query: `find src/ -name "*hook*" -o -name "*tool*"`

2. **Capture Path Implementation**: Investigate how capture paths are currently determined and managed
   - Query: `grep -r "capture.*path\|output.*capture" src/`
   - Query: Examine marker parsing logic for path prediction patterns

3. **Coordination Patterns**: Look for existing coordination mechanisms between hook phases
   - Query: `grep -r "coordination\|synchroniz\|shared.*state" src/`
   - Query: Review pipeline architecture for inter-hook communication

## Expected Findings

- **Current Hook Architecture**: Likely find basic hook infrastructure with separate Pre/Post phases
- **Path Prediction Logic**: Expect to find some form of output path determination, possibly in marker parsing
- **State Management**: May discover existing shared context or event passing mechanisms
- **Performance Considerations**: Should find evidence of timing/performance optimization strategies

## Key Takeaways

• **Predictive Coordination Benefits**: Including predicted capture paths in PreToolUse hooks would enable proactive resource allocation and validation before tool execution begins

• **State Consistency Challenge**: Coordination between Pre and Post hooks requires careful state management to handle prediction mismatches and dynamic path changes during execution

• **Performance vs Accuracy Trade-off**: Early path prediction improves efficiency but must balance computational cost of prediction against accuracy of dynamic path resolution

• **Error Recovery Complexity**: Predicted paths that prove incorrect require robust fallback mechanisms and clear error propagation between hook phases

• **Resource Optimization Opportunity**: PreToolUse path prediction enables early filesystem checks, permission validation, and resource reservation
