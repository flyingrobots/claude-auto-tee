# Closing Statement: Expert 003

The debate outcome validates prioritizing system integrity over performance optimization. Option B's victory represents disciplined engineering - choosing sustainable patterns over convenient shortcuts.

My support for Option B centered on separation of concerns and security vulnerability elimination. The existing cleanup mechanisms (`clean_concurrent_path()`) prove prediction brittleness requires dedicated recovery logic, indicating systemic architectural debt rather than elegant optimization.

**Key risks to monitor with Option B:**
- Token generation collision rates exceeding 0.01%
- PostToolUse execution latency increases beyond 2ms baseline
- Backward compatibility breaks in existing hook implementations

**Reassessment signals:**
- p99 latency degradation exceeding 5ms sustained over 48 hours
- Hook failure rate increases above historical 0.1% baseline
- Token correlation failures approaching 1% threshold
- Security audit findings related to token generation entropy

The decision eliminates TOCTOU vulnerabilities while maintaining functional equivalence through loose coupling. Long-term maintainability justifies short-term implementation effort. System boundaries preserved today prevent architectural erosion tomorrow.
