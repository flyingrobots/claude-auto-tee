# Closing Statement - Expert 001

While I respect the debate's conclusion favoring Option B, I remain concerned about abandoning path prediction entirely. The reactive-only approach creates blind spots in resource planning and coordination that could manifest as performance bottlenecks under load.

Key risks to monitor with Option B:
- Resource contention when multiple tools access overlapping paths simultaneously
- Cache invalidation cascades that could have been anticipated
- Coordination overhead scaling poorly as tool complexity increases

Critical metrics for reassessment:
1. Tool execution latency percentiles (p95, p99) - watch for degradation
2. Resource lock wait times - spikes indicate coordination failures
3. Cache miss rates - unexpected increases suggest poor invalidation timing

If we observe sustained degradation in these metrics, particularly during concurrent operations, we should revisit path prediction as a proactive coordination mechanism. The simplicity of Option B is appealing, but system performance shouldn't be sacrificed for implementation elegance.
