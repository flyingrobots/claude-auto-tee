# Closing Statement: Architectural Reliability Achieved

While I advocated for token-only coordination (Option C), Option B's victory represents a philosophical alignment with the core principle: eliminating prediction brittleness. Both approaches prioritize architectural integrity over marginal optimizations, making this outcome acceptable.

The debate revealed that existing cleanup mechanisms signal systematic fragility rather than edge-case handling. Option B's path elimination removes the prediction-validation cycle entirely, achieving the reliability goals that motivated my token-only preference.

**Critical monitoring signals for Option B implementation:**
- Hook execution latency distribution (p95/p99 tracking)
- Token correlation success rates (target 100% with collision detection)  
- Elimination of cleanup mechanism invocations as validation of prediction removal
- System resource utilization patterns during peak load scenarios

The 1-2ms performance trade-off represents sound engineering: choosing deterministic behavior over probabilistic optimization with compound failure modes. Success depends on robust token generation and comprehensive monitoring of operational characteristics during rollout phases.
