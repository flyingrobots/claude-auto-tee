# Closing Statement: Expert 004

While Option B's simplicity has merit, we must acknowledge the operational risks of reactive-only coordination. My preference for Option D reflected concerns about system stability under high-frequency tool usage patterns.

Key monitoring priorities for Option B implementation:

**Performance Metrics:**
- Tool execution latency percentiles (p95, p99)
- Queue depth and processing time under burst loads
- Memory consumption during concurrent operations

**User Experience Signals:**
- Response time degradation patterns
- Error rates during peak usage
- User session abandonment after tool delays

**Reassessment Triggers:**
- Sustained p95 latency > 500ms
- Error rates exceeding 2% during normal operations
- User complaints about system responsiveness

The reactive approach may work initially, but we should prepare fallback strategies when scale demands proactive coordination. Success depends on robust monitoring and quick adaptation when performance thresholds are breached.
