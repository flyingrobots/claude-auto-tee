# Round 1: Architectural Integrity Must Prevail

Expert 001's appeal to "existing implementations" misses a crucial point: just because something is implemented doesn't make it architecturally sound. The current `pretooluse-markers.sh` demonstrates the exact coupling problems I highlighted - it replicates path generation logic that belongs in the main capture system, creating maintenance debt.

Expert 005's security concerns reinforce my architectural arguments. The TOCTOU vulnerabilities and attack surface expansion they describe are direct consequences of the architectural coupling I identified. Security failures often stem from poor separation of concerns.

**Responding to Expert 001's "Performance Optimization" claim**: The 2ms overhead saved by path prediction pales compared to the technical debt created. Premature optimization at the cost of architectural integrity is a classic anti-pattern. The system's maintainability is worth more than microseconds.

**Addressing Expert 004's "User Experience Enhancement"**: This conflates implementation details with user value. Users care about reliable capture, not whether Claude knows paths beforehand. Token-based coordination delivers the same correlation benefits without architectural compromise.

**Supporting Expert 002's reliability argument**: The 99% vs 100% reliability distinction is architecturally significant. Distributed systems principles demand we eliminate single points of failure - path prediction creates exactly such a failure point between hooks.

The fundamental issue remains: PreToolUse hooks should notify, not predict. Path generation belongs in the capture system where it can be properly validated, secured, and maintained. Token-based coordination preserves loose coupling while enabling the coordination that proponents claim to need.

We're not choosing between features - we're choosing between architectural debt and architectural integrity.
