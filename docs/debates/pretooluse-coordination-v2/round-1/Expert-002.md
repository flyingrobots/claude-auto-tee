# Round 1: Strengthening the Token-Only Approach

Expert 001's "performance optimization" argument fundamentally misses the point - they claim path prediction "eliminates redundant work" but ignore the overhead of prediction validation and mismatch handling. The current `clean_concurrent_path()` cleanup indicates prediction failures are frequent enough to require dedicated recovery mechanisms.

Expert 005's security concerns align with my position but overstate the risks. The real security benefit isn't avoiding TOCTOU vulnerabilities - it's eliminating the entire prediction-validation cycle that creates unnecessary complexity.

Expert 003 correctly identifies architectural coupling violations, but I must address Expert 004's "user experience enhancement" claim. Token-based coordination provides identical UX benefits without path brittleness - Claude can still prepare context using session tokens as correlation keys.

**Strengthened Position**: The existing `pretooluse-markers.sh` evidence actually supports token coordination. The script's sophisticated timestamp handling and fallback logic proves path prediction is complex and error-prone. Why maintain this complexity when simple UUID tokens provide equivalent coordination with zero prediction failures?

**Key Counter-Argument**: Expert 001 claims "99%+ accuracy" but ignores that 1% failure rate multiplied across thousands of daily executions equals hundreds of coordination failures. Production systems require 100% reliability, not statistical accuracy.

**Implementation Reality**: The `inject_concurrent_safe_marker()` function already embeds process IDs and timestamps - replacing predicted paths with UUID tokens requires minimal architectural change while eliminating all prediction edge cases.

Token coordination isn't compromise - it's optimization through simplification.
