**Responding to Expert 001's Performance Claims**

Expert 001's assertion that path prediction enables "immediate resource allocation" ignores the security cost. The existing `inject_concurrent_safe_marker()` doesn't demonstrate reliability - it demonstrates attack surface expansion. Each prediction code path is a potential injection vector.

**Critical Flaw in Expert 004's Token Verification**

Expert 004's "token-based coordination verification" approach still requires path prediction first, preserving all the security vulnerabilities I identified. Verification tokens don't eliminate TOCTOU attacks - they just add complexity while the core temporal race condition remains unaddressed.

**Supporting Expert 002's and 003's Token-Only Approach**

Expert 002 correctly identifies the "99% reliability" problem, but understates the security implications of that 1% failure rate. Expert 003's architectural analysis reveals the deeper issue: tight coupling creates security boundary violations.

**Security Evidence Counter to Expert 001**

The claim that PreToolUse enables "early security validation" is backwards. True security validation can only occur AFTER actual file creation with real permissions and ownership. Validating predicted paths creates a false security boundary - you're validating theoretical state, not actual state.

**Enhanced Token-Only Implementation**

Generate cryptographically secure session UUIDs in PreToolUse, pass through environment variables to PostToolUse. This eliminates prediction accuracy issues AND the temporal attack window. PostToolUse validates actual paths against tokens, providing real security validation with O(1) lookup performance.

The fundamental principle: secure systems validate reality, not predictions.
