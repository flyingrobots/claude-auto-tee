# Opening Statement: Against PreToolUse Path Prediction

**Position**: PreToolUse hooks should NOT include predicted capture paths. Instead, adopt token-based coordination (Option C) for architectural integrity and system reliability.

## Core Arguments

**1. Architectural Coupling Violation**: Path prediction creates tight coupling between PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks, violating the Single Responsibility Principle. The PreToolUse hook becomes responsible for both notification AND path generation, while PostToolUse must validate predictions it had no part in creating. This coupling makes the system brittle - changes to path generation logic require coordinated updates across both hooks.

**2. State Management Anti-Pattern**: The current architecture lacks proper inter-hook state coordination mechanisms. Path prediction forces PreToolUse to make assumptions about future system state (temp file creation, timestamp generation, concurrent execution conflicts) that may not hold when PostToolUse executes. This prediction-reality mismatch creates a fundamental architectural inconsistency.

**3. Security Boundary Issues**: Path prediction bypasses PostToolUse validation boundaries. When PreToolUse announces a path before it exists, we lose the security benefit of PostToolUse verifying actual file creation and permissions. This creates potential attack vectors where predicted paths could be manipulated or hijacked between hook phases.

**4. SOLID Principle Violations**: Adding predicted paths violates the Open/Closed Principle - every modification to path prediction logic requires PostToolUse modifications. It also violates Dependency Inversion by creating concrete dependencies between hook phases rather than depending on abstractions.

## Recommended Solution

Token-based coordination (Option C) maintains proper separation of concerns while enabling hook communication. PreToolUse generates a session token, PostToolUse references the same token with actual paths. This approach follows Observer pattern principles and enables loose coupling.

## Critical Risks

The timestamp-based prediction logic in the current implementation already shows fragility across platforms (GNU date vs standard date, millisecond support variations). Adding this complexity to PreToolUse multiplies these cross-platform risks unnecessarily.

Token-based coordination is architecturally superior, more secure, and maintains the modularity essential for system maintainability.
