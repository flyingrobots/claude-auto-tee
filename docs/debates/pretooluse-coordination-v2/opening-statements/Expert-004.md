# Opening Statement: Support Predicted Paths with Robust Coordination

**Position: PreToolUse hooks should include predicted capture paths with token-based coordination verification.**

The research reveals that path prediction is already implemented and functional through the `predict_capture_path()` function, replicating the main script's timestamp-based generation logic with cross-platform support. However, the current coordination mechanism is fragile and needs strengthening.

**Four key reasons support this approach:**

**1. User Experience Enhancement**: Predicted paths enable Claude to understand where output will be captured before execution begins, allowing for better context preparation and error handling. This improves the interactive debugging workflow significantly.

**2. Existing Infrastructure Leverage**: The `pretooluse-markers.sh` implementation already handles cross-platform timestamp generation (`gdate` detection, fallback mechanisms) and path normalization. Building on this foundation is more efficient than abandoning it.

**3. Coordination Through Verification Tokens**: Instead of relying solely on path matching, implement a coordination token system where PreToolUse generates both predicted paths and unique verification tokens. PostToolUse validates both the actual path and token match, ensuring coordination integrity even under race conditions.

**4. Graceful Degradation**: With token-based coordination, mismatched predictions don't break the system - PostToolUse can still process actual paths while logging coordination failures for monitoring.

**Explicit risks**: Cross-platform timestamp collisions under high concurrency, race conditions between prediction and creation, and increased complexity in the coordination logic.

**Unknown factors**: Impact on system performance with additional token generation and the reliability of stderr marker injection across different shell environments.

The solution balances functionality with robustness while leveraging existing proven infrastructure.
