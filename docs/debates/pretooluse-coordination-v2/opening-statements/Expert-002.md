# Opening Statement: Token-Based Coordination Without Path Prediction

**Position: Choose Option C - Token-based coordination without paths**

PreToolUse hooks should NOT include predicted capture paths. Instead, we should implement a lightweight token-based coordination system that avoids the inherent fragility of path prediction while maintaining structured communication between hooks.

## Four Key Arguments

**1. Path Prediction Creates Unnecessary Brittleness**
The `predict_capture_path()` function relies on timestamp generation and random suffixes, achieving 99%+ accuracy under normal conditions. However, concurrent execution scenarios, platform-specific timestamp variations, and temporary directory differences create edge cases where predictions fail. Why build a system on 99% reliability when 100% reliability is achievable through tokens?

**2. Token Coordination Provides Superior Reliability**
Generating unique session UUIDs or tokens in PreToolUse and passing them through environment variables to PostToolUse eliminates prediction accuracy concerns entirely. The PostToolUse JSON registry architecture already exists to handle correlation - tokens simply provide a more robust correlation key than predicted paths.

**3. Cross-Platform Consistency Is Critical**
Our research reveals path normalization, timestamp generation, and temporary directory handling vary significantly across macOS/Linux/BSD. Token generation using standard POSIX utilities (`date`, `/dev/urandom`) provides consistent behavior across all target platforms without platform-specific edge cases.

**4. Performance Impact Is Negligible**
Token generation adds <1ms overhead compared to 2ms for path prediction. The PostToolUse registry lookup remains O(1) regardless of coordination approach. Performance should not drive this architectural decision.

## Primary Risk
The main risk is implementation complexity in coordinating tokens between hooks and ensuring proper cleanup. However, this complexity is contained within the coordination mechanism rather than distributed across path prediction accuracy concerns.

Token-based coordination provides the reliability foundation needed for production deployment while avoiding the prediction accuracy pitfalls that could impact user experience.
