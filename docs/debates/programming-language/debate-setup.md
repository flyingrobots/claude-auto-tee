# Debate Setup

## Expert Assignments
- **Expert 001**: performance-engineer - Performance impact, execution speed, resource optimization
- **Expert 002**: devops-troubleshooter - Deployment, cross-platform compatibility, operational concerns
- **Expert 003**: security-auditor - Security implications, attack vectors, dependency risks
- **Expert 004**: architect-reviewer - Code maintainability, design patterns, long-term architecture
- **Expert 005**: c-pro - Systems programming expertise, low-level performance optimization

## Debate Order
Randomized presentation order: Expert 002, Expert 005, Expert 001, Expert 004, Expert 003

## Rules
- Experts identify only by number (001, 002, etc.) during debate
- Domain expertise revealed only in setup document
- Arguments evaluated on merit, not authority
- Each expert must read all previous statements in their phase before responding

## Voting Options Framework
Experts may propose additional options during debate, but initial framework:
1. **Node.js + bash-parser**: JavaScript with mature AST library
2. **C/C++**: Native systems language for maximum performance
3. **Rust**: Memory-safe systems language with performance
4. **Go**: Compiled language with excellent JSON/deployment support
5. **Python**: Rapid development with bash parsing capabilities
6. **[Additional options proposed during debate]**

## Context from Previous Debate
The activation strategy debate established these priorities:
- AST-based parsing is mandatory (not regex)
- Performance is critical (25,000x difference observed)
- Cross-platform reliability is essential
- Simple, predictable behavior preferred
- Pure pipe-only detection strategy chosen
