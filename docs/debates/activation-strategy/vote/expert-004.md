**Choice**: Option A: Pure Pipe-Only Detection

**Rationale**: After reading all expert final statements, the evidence overwhelmingly supports pure pipe-only detection as the only viable choice for production environments. While I initially considered a plugin architecture approach, the cumulative analysis from all experts demonstrates that pattern matching introduces fundamental flaws that cannot be mitigated through architectural solutions.

## Key Factors

**1. Production Environment Reliability**
Expert 001's security analysis and Expert 002's performance findings converge on a critical deployment reality: pattern matching creates production risks that outweigh its benefits. The 165x performance degradation and DoS vulnerabilities aren't academic concerns - they're deployment killers. In my experience with CI/CD and platform compatibility, any tool that can bring down production systems will be banned by operations teams, regardless of its functional benefits.

**2. Cross-Platform Operational Simplicity**
Expert 004's (my original) platform analysis revealed that pattern matching creates exponential complexity across deployment environments. After seeing Expert 005's architectural analysis of O(n²) maintenance costs, it's clear that even a plugin architecture cannot escape this fundamental complexity explosion. Every pattern × platform × shell variant creates a testing matrix that becomes unmaintainable.

**3. Total Cost of Ownership**
Expert 003's UX evolution from pattern matching to pipe-only detection highlights a crucial insight I initially undervalued: developer productivity trumps feature coverage. Expert 002's CI/CD cost analysis ($83 minutes vs 10 seconds) quantifies this perfectly. The operational costs of supporting pattern matching across diverse environments will far exceed any productivity gains from better command coverage.

**Additional Supporting Evidence**:
- Expert 001's security principle of "fail securely" mandates choosing the minimal attack surface
- Expert 002's discovery that performance degradation constitutes a security vulnerability
- Expert 003's recognition that predictable behavior enables user self-service and reduces support burden
- Expert 005's architectural analysis showing that complexity debt accumulates faster than anticipated benefits

**Why Not Plugin Architecture**: While Expert 005's plugin architecture proposal is architecturally elegant, it still requires maintaining the complex pattern matching core. The security, performance, and platform compatibility issues remain unsolved - they're just abstracted into plugins. For production deployment reliability, we need zero complexity in the core activation logic.

## Conclusion

Pure pipe-only detection with enhanced documentation and tooling represents the only choice that satisfies production reliability requirements across all evaluated dimensions: security, performance, user experience, platform compatibility, and long-term maintainability.
