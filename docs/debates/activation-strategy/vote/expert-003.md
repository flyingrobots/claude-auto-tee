**Choice**: Option A - Pure Pipe-Only Detection

**Rationale**: 

After reading all five expert final statements, I am convinced that Option A represents the optimal user experience strategy for claude-auto-tee. This conclusion is based on compelling evidence from all expert domains that converges on a fundamental insight: **predictable, high-performance tools with clear mental models provide superior user experience compared to feature-rich but complex alternatives**.

The debate revealed that user experience is not just about feature coverage—it's about the total interaction experience including performance, predictability, cross-platform consistency, and long-term reliability. Pattern matching optimizes for coverage at the expense of every other UX dimension, while pipe-only detection optimizes for the user experience fundamentals.

Most critically, Expert 002's performance analysis showing 165x degradation (3.8s vs 23ms for 1000 commands) demonstrates that pattern matching creates **performance-induced user experience failure**. Any tool that adds perceptible latency will be perceived as broken regardless of its functional benefits.

Expert 001's security analysis reveals that predictable behavior is itself a security control, which aligns perfectly with user experience needs for transparent, auditable activation. Expert 004's platform compatibility insights show that environment-specific pattern variations violate fundamental UX consistency principles. Expert 005's architectural analysis demonstrates that the O(n²) maintainability complexity of pattern matching represents a long-term UX degradation risk through increased bug reports and behavioral inconsistencies.

**Key Factors**:

- **Performance IS User Experience**: Expert 002's demonstration that pattern matching creates 165x performance degradation shows that latency kills user adoption regardless of functional benefits. Users prefer fast, predictable tools over slow, comprehensive ones.

- **Mental Model Alignment**: Developers already understand pipes for output routing (`command | tee log.txt`). Pipe-only detection amplifies existing mental models rather than creating new ones, reducing cognitive overhead to zero.

- **Cross-Domain Convergence**: All five experts ultimately support pipe-only detection from their domain perspectives—security (attack surface), performance (resource efficiency), platform compatibility (operational reliability), and architecture (maintainability). This convergence indicates alignment with fundamental software engineering principles.

The optimal user experience strategy is pipe-only detection enhanced with excellent documentation, helper tools, and workflow integration guidance. This approach maximizes predictability, performance, and discoverability while respecting existing user workflows and mental models.
