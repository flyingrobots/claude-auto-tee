**Choice**: Option A: Strategic Phased Release - 1-2 weeks operational fixes + coordinated community launch

**Rationale**: After comprehensive analysis of all expert final statements, Option A represents the optimal synthesis of technical excellence, market opportunity, and operational sustainability. This choice reflects architectural maturity under market pressure - recognizing that sustainable software must serve both technical ideals and business realities.

The unanimous expert convergence around this approach provides extraordinary validation. Five specialists using completely different analytical frameworks (market validation, operational risk, developer experience, distribution strategy, and architectural integrity) independently arrived at identical conclusions. This convergence eliminates the strategic uncertainty that would otherwise make this decision risky.

From an architectural perspective, Option A addresses the critical distinction between "code architecture" (which is already exemplary) and "system integration architecture" (which requires targeted completion). The proposed operational fixes don't compromise architectural elegance - they complete it by addressing platform abstraction violations and resource lifecycle gaps that would otherwise create technical debt.

**Key Factors**:

- **Architectural Integrity Preservation**: The proposed fixes maintain the core 20-line philosophical simplicity while addressing legitimate operational gaps. Cross-platform compatibility and resource management are architectural requirements, not feature creep. Expert 002's operational analysis revealed blind spots in my initial assessment that, when addressed, strengthen rather than weaken the overall architecture.

- **Expert Consensus Validation**: The unanimous convergence across five different analytical frameworks provides extraordinary confidence in this approach. When market analysts (Expert 001), operations specialists (Expert 002), developer experience experts (Expert 003), and distribution strategists (Expert 004) all independently reach the same conclusion through their own methodologies, it indicates we've identified the optimal path rather than a compromise solution.

- **Technical Debt Prevention**: Immediate release (Option B) would create compounding architectural debt through platform-specific workarounds, community reputation damage, and crisis-driven rather than design-driven decision making. Extended development (Option C) risks architectural perfectionism that serves engineering ego rather than user value. Option A strikes the precise balance between technical excellence and market sustainability that defines mature engineering judgment.

The proposed operational fixes (environment-aware temp directory detection, basic cleanup mechanisms, and graceful failure diagnostics) enhance rather than compromise the architectural advantages that make claude-auto-tee special. They represent the minimum viable operational standards that prevent the tool from being "elegant but broken" on Windows systems or in corporate environments.

This vote reflects not just technical analysis but architectural leadership - understanding that the best architecture is one that succeeds in real deployment scenarios while maintaining its essential simplicity and competitive advantages.
