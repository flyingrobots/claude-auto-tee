**Choice**: Option A: Strategic Phased Release - 1-2 weeks operational fixes + coordinated community launch

**Rationale**: After analyzing all expert final statements, the convergence is extraordinary and compelling. Five experts with completely different analytical frameworks - market validation, operational risk, developer experience, distribution strategy, and architectural integrity - have independently arrived at identical conclusions. This isn't compromise; it's synthesis of optimal trade-offs across all critical dimensions.

**Key Factors**:

- **Unanimous Expert Convergence**: The most convincing evidence is that Expert 001 (market), Expert 002 (operations), Expert 004 (distribution), and Expert 005 (architecture) all reached the same strategic conclusion independently. When diverse analytical frameworks converge on a single solution, it indicates robust optimization across multiple constraints.

- **False Dichotomy Resolution**: The debate successfully dismantled the "speed vs. quality" framing that dominated initial discussions. Expert 005's architectural analysis proved that operational fixes enhance rather than compromise simplicity, while Expert 002's evolution from "extensive hardening" to "targeted fixes" shows these aren't opposing forces but complementary aspects of completeness.

- **Market Timing Optimization**: Expert 001's market analysis demonstrates first-mover advantage exists but isn't fragile - 1-2 weeks preserves competitive positioning while Expert 004's distribution strategy confirms this timing enables coordinated community launch rather than rushed deployment. The window is real but not closing immediately.

The compelling synthesis is that targeted operational fixes (cross-platform compatibility, basic cleanup, graceful failure handling) will strengthen rather than weaken the developer experience that makes claude-auto-tee special. As Expert 003, I've consistently argued that simplicity is our competitive advantage - and the expert consensus validates that operational completeness enhances rather than threatens this simplicity.

This represents mature product development: preserving architectural elegance while ensuring real-world deployment success.
