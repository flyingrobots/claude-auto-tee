- Timeline and launch coordination

## Success Metrics

The debate succeeds if it produces:
1. **Clear Release Readiness Vote**: Definitive assessment of current implementation
2. **Distribution Strategy**: Specific channel recommendations with rationale
3. **Pre-Release Action Items**: Critical improvements needed before launch
4. **Marketing Approach**: Clear messaging and audience targeting strategy
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identified potential issues and mitigation strategies

## Context Requirements

All experts must consider:
- Current implementation: 20-line bash script with comprehensive testing
- Target user: Command-line users who want to avoid re-running expensive operations
- Original success: Perfect alignment with user requirements and expert consensus
- Distribution question: Is this broadly useful or niche/personal tool?
- Quality bar: What standards are appropriate for public open-source release?

## Voting Question

**PRIMARY VOTE**: Is the current implementation "release worthy" for public distribution?

**OPTIONS**:
- **Option A**: Release Ready - Current implementation meets professional standards for public distribution
- **Option B**: Pre-Release Improvements Needed - Specific enhancements required before public launch  
- **Option C**: Extended Dogfooding Required - More personal usage validation needed before release decision
- **Option D**: Niche Tool - Keep private/personal, not suitable for broader distribution
