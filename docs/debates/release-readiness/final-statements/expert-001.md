- Return: Maximum first-mover advantage capture
- Risk: Higher support burden and potential market reputation damage
- **Business Assessment: Higher risk/reward profile**

**Option C: Extended Validation**
- Investment: 3-6 months opportunity cost
- Return: Comprehensive market validation but delayed entry
