# Expert 001: Round 1 Response

## My Perspective

After analyzing all opening statements, I maintain that **system boundary design** remains the critical foundation, but acknowledge that my colleagues have identified essential layers that must be built on top of this foundation.

**Expert 002's context injection** and **Expert 004's cognitive optimization** address the crucial "last mile" problem - even with perfect capture persistence, Claude must still be made aware of available outputs in a cognitively optimal way. This reinforces my registry approach but suggests the PostToolUse hook should also generate **immediate context injections** alongside persistent storage.

**Expert 003's state management concerns** validate my emphasis on atomic capture and failure isolation, but their pure PostToolUse approach may be too aggressive. We still need fallback mechanisms for edge cases where the registry approach fails.

**Expert 005's context intelligence layer** represents valuable enhancement, but adds significant complexity. While semantic understanding is desirable, we should prioritize getting basic structured capture working reliably first.

**Refined Position**: The optimal strategy combines:
1. **Structured registry persistence** (my core position)
2. **Immediate context injection** (Expert 002/004 insights)  
3. **Graceful degradation** to address Expert 003's reliability concerns

The PostToolUse hook should:
- Parse `tool_response.stderr` for capture file paths
- Update persistent JSON registry with metadata
- Generate formatted context blocks appended to tool output
- Set environment variables for immediate discoverability

This creates **multiple communication channels** ensuring Claude receives capture information even if individual channels fail:
- Visual context blocks (immediate awareness)
- Environment variables (session persistence)
- JSON registry (cross-session continuity)

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: YES

**Reason**: Critical implementation details remain unresolved. We need to address Expert 003's concerns about cache invalidation, Expert 002's context window optimization, and define specific formats for Expert 004's context injection strategy. The approaches are complementary but require integration design.

## Proposed Voting Options

- **Option A**: Multi-Channel Architecture - Registry + Context Injection + Environment Variables
- **Option B**: Pure Context Injection - Focus on Expert 004's cognitive optimization approach  
- **Option C**: Staged Implementation - Start with registry, add context injection in phase 2
- **Option D**: Hybrid State Management - Expert 003's approach with registry fallback
- **Option E**: Context Intelligence - Expert 005's AI-powered context processing layer
