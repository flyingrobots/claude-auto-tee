# Conclusion: PostToolUse Hook Strategy for Claude Auto-Tee

## Executive Summary

The expert panel achieved strong consensus that **PostToolUse hooks fundamentally change the solution architecture** for claude-auto-tee. Rather than relying on Claude to parse stderr messages, PostToolUse enables a robust hybrid architecture combining structured persistence with immediate context injection.

## Core Consensus: Hybrid Architecture

All five experts converged on a three-layer solution:

### Layer 1: Structured Capture Registry (PostToolUse)
- **Parse tool_response** to extract tee output paths from stderr
- **Write to JSON registry** at `~/.claude/captures.json`
- **Include metadata**: timestamp, command, size, hash, dependencies
- **Set environment variable** pointing to latest captures

### Layer 2: Immediate Context Injection  
- **Generate formatted context blocks** that appear in next Claude interaction
- **Visual delimiters** for cognitive optimization
- **Action-oriented prompts**: "Use `cat /tmp/xyz.log` for full output"
- **Automatic injection** via CLAUDE_CONTEXT or similar mechanism

### Layer 3: Intelligent Lifecycle Management
- **Track temporal validity** of captured output
- **Dependency tracking** between commands
- **Confidence scoring** based on age and system changes
- **Automatic invalidation** when dependencies change

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Implementation (Week 1)
```bash
# PostToolUse hook pseudocode
1. Parse tool_response for "Full output saved to: PATH"
2. Extract PATH and metadata
3. Append to ~/.claude/captures.json
4. Set CLAUDE_LAST_CAPTURE=PATH
5. Generate context block for next interaction
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Reliability (Week 2)
- Add structured stderr markers in PreToolUse
- Implement robust JSON registry with rotation
- Add visual context blocks with formatting
- Test cross-platform compatibility

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Week 3+)
- Add dependency tracking
- Implement freshness scoring
- Create invalidation rules
- Add semantic enhancement

## Key Technical Insights

### 1. PostToolUse Changes Everything
**Expert 001**: "PostToolUse provides the missing piece - reliable post-execution processing with full access to tool_response, eliminating the fragile stderr parsing requirement."

### 2. Context Injection > Discovery
**Expert 004**: "Claude shouldn't have to discover captures - they should be immediately visible in context, making captured output feel more accessible than re-running."

### 3. Temporal Intelligence Critical
**Expert 005**: "Static captures become misleading over time. We must track dependencies and freshness to prevent Claude from using stale data."

### 4. Reliability Through Simplicity
**Expert 003**: "Start with bulletproof basics - file persistence and environment variables - before adding semantic layers."

### 5. Cognitive Optimization Matters
**Expert 002**: "Format captured output as 'enhanced context' that feels superior to raw command output, incentivizing reuse."

```

## Success Metrics

- **Primary**: 100% Claude awareness of captures (vs current 10% failure rate)
- **Secondary**: Zero unnecessary command re-runs
- **Tertiary**: <100ms overhead per capture
- **Operational**: Automatic cleanup of stale captures

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Registry corruption**: Use atomic writes with backup
- **Context injection failure**: Fallback to environment variables
- **PostToolUse hook failure**: Graceful degradation to current behavior

### Operational Risks  
- **Disk space**: Implement rotation and cleanup
- **Stale context**: Freshness scoring and invalidation
- **Cross-platform issues**: Extensive testing matrix

## Final Recommendation

**Implement the hybrid architecture in three phases**, starting with PostToolUse registry management (Phase 1) to achieve immediate 100% capture awareness, then adding context injection (Phase 2) for cognitive optimization, and finally intelligence layers (Phase 3) for long-term reliability.

The availability of PostToolUse hooks transforms this from a "best effort" notification problem into a deterministic state management solution. The expert consensus strongly supports leveraging this capability for a robust, user-friendly implementation that eliminates command re-runs while maintaining operational reliability.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Modify PostToolUse hook to parse tool_response

## System Boundaries and Inter-Process Communication Analysis

### Executive Summary

From a system boundaries and inter-process communication perspective, the PostToolUse hook represents a paradigm shift from **push-based notification** to **structured data persistence**. The current PreToolUse approach suffers from communication boundary violations—it relies on stderr message parsing across process boundaries, creating an unreliable information channel with ~10% failure rate.

### Core Technical Assessment

**Current Architecture Violations:**
1. **Boundary Crossing Anti-Pattern**: Information flows from PreToolUse (injection) → Bash execution → stderr parsing → Claude memory, crossing multiple process boundaries with lossy communication
2. **Temporal Coupling**: Claude must parse stderr messages *during* execution, creating timing dependencies
3. **State Inconsistency**: No persistent registry means capture information dies with process termination

**PostToolUse Opportunities:**
The PostToolUse hook receives structured JSON with complete tool response, enabling **clean separation of concerns**:
- **Injection Phase** (PreToolUse): Pure command modification
- **Registration Phase** (PostToolUse): Structured data persistence
- **Discovery Phase** (Claude): Query-based retrieval

### Optimal Strategy Recommendation

**1. Capture Registry Architecture**
Implement a persistent capture registry with clear API boundaries:

```bash
# PostToolUse hook workflow
REGISTRY_FILE="/tmp/.claude-captures.json"
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "captures": [
    {
      "capture_id": "claude-1234567890.log",
      "command_hash": "sha256...",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "file_path": "/tmp/claude-1234567890.log",
      "file_size": 1024,
      "status": "complete"
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Environment-Based Discovery Mechanism**
Set structured environment variables that Claude can access:
```bash
export CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_LAST_CAPTURE="/tmp/claude-1234567890.log"
export CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_CAPTURE_COUNT="3"
export CLAUDE_AUTO_TEE_CAPTURE_REGISTRY="/tmp/.claude-captures.json"
```

**3. Clear Communication Protocol**
- PostToolUse hook processes tool_response.stderr to extract capture file paths
- Validates capture file exists and is readable
- Updates persistent registry with structured metadata
- Sets environment variables for immediate discoverability
- Claude queries environment first, falls back to registry for history

### System Boundary Benefits

**Process Isolation**: Each component operates within clean boundaries:
- PreToolUse: Command injection (stateless)
- Bash execution: Command processing (isolated)
- PostToolUse: Data registration (persistent)
- Claude: Query and retrieval (consumer)

**Failure Isolation**: Registry persistence ensures capture information survives:
- Process termination
- Session boundaries
- Tool invocation failures
- Network interruptions

**Scalability**: Registry-based approach handles:
- Concurrent captures from parallel commands
- Cross-session discovery
- Historical capture queries
- Multiple Claude instances

### Implementation Priorities

**Phase 1: Core Registry**
1. PostToolUse hook extracts capture paths from stderr
2. Maintains JSON registry with file metadata
3. Sets environment variables for immediate access

**Phase 2: Enhanced Discovery**
1. Claude checks environment variables first
2. Falls back to registry query for historical data
3. Automatic cleanup of stale entries

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
1. Cross-session persistence
2. Capture indexing and search
3. Distributed registry for multi-instance scenarios

### Proposed Voting Options

1. **Registry + Environment Variables** (Recommended): Structured persistence with immediate environment-based discovery
2. **Environment Variables Only**: Lightweight approach using only env vars
3. **File-based Markers**: Simple file creation for each capture
4. **Hybrid Notification**: Combine stdout messages with registry persistence
5. **Status Quo Enhancement**: Improve current stderr parsing reliability

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk**: Continuing with stderr parsing creates persistent reliability issues
**Medium Risk**: Pure environment variable approach may have session boundary issues  
**Low Risk**: Structured registry with environment fallback provides robust communication channels

The system boundaries analysis strongly favors structured data persistence over message passing for this use case, as capture information represents state rather than events.

# Expert 002 Opening Statement: LLM Integration Patterns and Context Management

## Executive Summary

From an LLM integration and context management perspective, the optimal strategy leverages PostToolUse hooks to create a **contextual memory layer** that makes captured output more accessible to Claude than re-execution. The key is making the captured data feel "native" to Claude's reasoning process.

## Core Strategy: Context-Aware Output Injection

### 1. Semantic Context Enhancement

PostToolUse hooks should not just store raw output but enhance it with semantic metadata:

```json
{
  "tool_execution_id": "bash_20250813_143052",
  "command": "npm test",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-13T14:30:52Z",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "working_directory": "/project/root",
  "output_summary": "27 tests passed, 0 failed, coverage 89%",
  "key_artifacts": ["coverage-report.html", "test-results.json"],
  "output_classification": "test_success"
}
```

### 2. Proactive Context Injection Pattern

Instead of waiting for Claude to ask for output, inject it immediately into the conversation context using a **shadow response** pattern:

- PostToolUse hook captures complete tool response
- Immediately append a contextual summary to Claude's working memory
- Use structured prompts that reference the captured output ID

### 3. Memory Hierarchy Design

Implement a three-tier memory system:

**Tier 1: Immediate Context** - Last 3-5 command outputs readily available
**Tier 2: Session Memory** - All outputs from current session, indexed by command type
**Tier 3: Persistent Knowledge** - Cross-session patterns and frequently referenced outputs

## LLM Behavioral Conditioning

### Anti-Rerun Prompt Engineering

Structure responses to make captured output feel more "real" than potential re-execution:

```
IMPORTANT: Command output from [timestamp] is available:
[Enhanced summary with key insights]
Full output stored as: execution_id_xyz
```

### Cognitive Load Reduction

Present outputs in Claude-friendly formats:
- Pre-parsed error messages with suggested fixes
- Extracted key metrics and status indicators  
- Contextual hints about what the output means for the current task

## Technical Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Response Enrichment Pipeline

```
PostToolUse → Parse Output → Extract Insights → Generate Summary → Inject Context
```

### 2. Intelligent Caching Strategy

- Cache semantically similar command patterns
- Pre-generate summaries for common command types
- Index outputs by project context and task type

### 3. Context Window Optimization

- Compress verbose outputs while preserving essential information
- Use reference IDs for full outputs to avoid token waste
- Prioritize recent and relevant outputs in active context

## Proposed Voting Options

**Option A**: Full Context Injection - Always inject enhanced summaries into Claude's immediate context
**Option B**: Reference-Based System - Store outputs with IDs and train Claude to reference them
**Option C**: Hybrid Approach - Inject summaries + maintain reference system for full details
**Option D**: Intelligent Triggers - Conditionally inject based on command type and likely Claude needs

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risks:
1. **Context Pollution** - Too much injected data overwhelming Claude's reasoning
2. **Stale Data** - Cached outputs becoming outdated
3. **Pattern Drift** - Claude learning to expect injected data and becoming dependent

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement context relevance scoring
- Time-based cache invalidation
- Gradual context reduction training

## Conclusion

The optimal strategy combines proactive context injection with intelligent caching. Success depends on making captured output feel more "natural" and accessible to Claude than the cognitive overhead of re-running commands. The system should anticipate Claude's needs while maintaining flexibility for edge cases.

**Key Success Metric**: Reduction in command re-execution rates while maintaining or improving task completion quality.

# opening-statements/expert-003.md
# Expert 003 Opening Statement: State Management and Operational Reliability

## Core Position

From a state management and operational reliability perspective, PostToolUse hooks represent a **paradigm shift** that requires fundamental changes to how we approach output capture and retrieval. The current PreToolUse tee injection is operationally fragile and creates unnecessary execution overhead.

## Critical Reliability Concerns

### 1. State Consistency Guarantees
The PostToolUse approach provides **atomic state capture** - we receive the complete tool response in a single JSON payload, eliminating the race conditions inherent in file-based tee operations. This is crucial for operational reliability where partial captures can lead to misleading diagnostics.

### 2. Failure Mode Analysis
Current tee injection creates multiple failure points:
- File system I/O failures during tee operations
- Permission issues with temporary files
- Disk space exhaustion during long-running commands
- Race conditions between tee writes and Claude's file reads

PostToolUse eliminates these failure vectors entirely by keeping state in memory until explicitly persisted.

## Proposed State Management Architecture

### Central State Store
```
CapturedOutputStore {
  toolExecutions: Map<ExecutionID, ToolResponse>
  indexByCommand: Map<CommandHash, ExecutionID[]>
  retentionPolicy: LRU with size/time limits
}
```

### Operational Strategy
1. **Immediate Capture**: PostToolUse hook captures ALL tool responses to central store
2. **Intelligent Indexing**: Index by command signature to enable fast lookups
3. **Proactive Suggestion**: When Claude attempts command re-execution, intercept and suggest cached output
4. **Graceful Degradation**: If cache miss occurs, allow execution but capture for future use

## Voting Options

I propose these strategic approaches for evaluation:

**Option A: Hybrid State Management**
- PostToolUse captures to persistent state store
- PreToolUse hook checks cache before execution
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing tee infrastructure

**Option B: Pure PostToolUse Architecture** 
- Complete migration to PostToolUse capture
- Eliminate tee injection entirely
- Implement smart caching with command fingerprinting

**Option C: Staged Migration Strategy**
- Phase 1: Parallel capture (both tee and PostToolUse)
- Phase 2: Preference for PostToolUse with tee fallback
- Phase 3: Complete PostToolUse adoption

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Scenarios
- **Cache Poisoning**: Stale cached outputs could mislead debugging efforts
- **Memory Pressure**: Large command outputs consuming excessive memory
- **Context Loss**: Loss of execution environment context between runs

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement cache invalidation based on file system changes
- Use streaming/chunked storage for large outputs
- Capture and store relevant environment metadata with each execution

## Recommendation

I advocate for **Option B: Pure PostToolUse Architecture** with robust state management, as it provides the cleanest operational model and eliminates the complexity overhead of maintaining dual capture mechanisms.

The key to success lies in building **intelligent caching** that understands command semantics and can make reliable decisions about when cached output remains valid versus when re-execution is necessary.

# opening-statements/expert-004.md
# Expert 004 Opening Statement: AI System Prompts and Information Presentation Optimization

## Problem Analysis from AI Systems Perspective

The core challenge is fundamentally about **information flow and cognitive load optimization** in human-AI interaction. From my expertise in AI system prompts and information presentation, the problem breaks down into three critical information architecture issues:

### 1. Information Persistence vs Working Memory Limitations

Claude operates with session-based working memory, not persistent state. The current approach relies on Claude parsing stderr messages and "remembering" capture paths - this creates a **fragile cognitive dependency** that inevitably fails due to:

- **Context window pressure** as conversations grow longer
- **Attention dilution** when multiple tools generate output simultaneously  
- **Memory decay** between tool invocations
- **Interference patterns** when stderr contains multiple file paths

### 2. Cognitive Load Distribution Problem

The current system places the burden of **discovery and state management** entirely on Claude's reasoning layer. This is suboptimal because:

- It requires Claude to actively parse, extract, and retain file paths
- It competes with the primary task focus (analyzing command output)
- It creates **dual-purpose attention splitting** between content analysis and metadata tracking
- It lacks **systematic reinforcement patterns** that would strengthen memory retention

### 3. Information Architecture Anti-Pattern

The current design exhibits a classic **"pull-based discovery"** anti-pattern where the consumer (Claude) must actively seek and maintain awareness of available resources, rather than having them **systematically presented** in the optimal cognitive format.

## Optimal Strategy: Context-Aware Information Injection

Based on AI system optimization principles, the solution should implement **proactive context enhancement** rather than reactive discovery:

### Core Strategy: PostToolUse Context Injection

**PostToolUse Hook Should Create Structured Metadata Supplements**

1. **Parse** `tool_response.stderr` for capture file paths
2. **Validate** capture file existence and readability  
3. **Generate** structured context blocks that will be **automatically visible** to Claude
4. **Inject** formatted metadata into the command output stream

### Implementation Framework

```bash
# PostToolUse Hook Pseudo-Implementation
if [[ "$tool_name" == "Bash" ]]; then
    # Extract capture paths from stderr
    capture_paths=$(echo "$stderr" | grep -o "Full output saved to: [^[:space:]]*" | cut -d' ' -f5-)
    
    if [[ -n "$capture_paths" ]]; then
        # Generate structured context block
        context_block="
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔄 CLAUDE-AUTO-TEE CAPTURE METADATA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CAPTURED OUTPUTS AVAILABLE:
$(format_capture_list "$capture_paths")

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
• Use 'Read' tool with these paths to access full output
• Files contain complete stdout/stderr (including truncated content)  
• Paths are absolute and immediately accessible

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
"
        # Append to tool output for guaranteed visibility
        echo "$context_block" >> "$session_metadata_file"
    fi
fi
```

### Why This Approach Optimizes AI Cognitive Patterns

1. **Visual Prominence**: Structured formatting with clear boundaries ensures information doesn't blend into output noise

2. **Cognitive Priming**: Context blocks activate the "file operation" reasoning pathway before Claude analyzes primary output

3. **Reduced Working Memory Load**: Eliminates need for Claude to parse, extract, and retain file paths

4. **Systematic Reinforcement**: Every capture generates consistent, formatted metadata that reinforces usage patterns

5. **Zero Discovery Overhead**: Information is **pushed** to Claude rather than requiring active discovery

### Information Presentation Optimization Principles

**Format Design for Maximum Cognitive Impact:**

- **High-contrast visual boundaries** (box characters, consistent spacing)
- **Semantic grouping** (paths, instructions, metadata separated)
- **Action-oriented language** ("Use 'Read' tool..." not "Files available...")
- **Context-aware sizing** (brief for single captures, detailed for multiple)
- **Progressive disclosure** (essential info first, details follow)

## Proposed Voting Options

Based on optimal information architecture principles:

**Option A: Context Injection Strategy**
- PostToolUse generates formatted context blocks
- Blocks appended to tool output for guaranteed visibility
- Standardized format optimizes Claude's file operation reasoning

**Option B: Environment Metadata Strategy**  
- PostToolUse writes structured metadata files
- Environment variables point Claude to metadata locations
- Requires explicit discovery but provides rich contextual data

**Option C: Hybrid Push-Pull Strategy**
- Immediate context injection for current captures
- Persistent registry for cross-session discovery
- Optimizes both immediate awareness and long-term accessibility

## Success Criteria from AI Systems Perspective

1. **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Claude should never need to parse stderr for file paths
2. **Attention Optimization**: File awareness should enhance, not compete with, primary task focus  
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Consistent information formatting should strengthen usage patterns over time
4. **Zero Cognitive Overhead**: Available captures should be immediately apparent without discovery effort
5. **Scalable Information Architecture**: Approach should work with 1 capture or 20 captures equally well

The optimal solution treats this as an **information presentation problem** rather than a state management problem, leveraging how AI systems naturally process structured context to achieve reliable awareness without cognitive burden.

# opening-statements/expert-005.md
# Expert 005 Opening Statement: Context Management Strategy

## Executive Summary

From a context management perspective, PostToolUse hooks represent a paradigm shift from reactive output capture to proactive knowledge persistence. The optimal strategy must prioritize **context continuity** and **agent handoff efficiency** over traditional output redirection.

## Core Position: Context-First Architecture

### 1. Context Persistence as Primary Goal

The fundamental issue isn't just preventing command re-execution—it's ensuring that **context survives agent transitions**. PostToolUse hooks should create a persistent knowledge layer that transcends individual command outputs:

- **Structured Context Storage**: Raw stdout/stderr is insufficient. We need semantic understanding of what each command accomplished
- **Agent Memory Continuity**: Each agent handoff should include curated context, not just raw logs
- **Decision Trail Preservation**: Capture not just what happened, but why decisions were made

### 2. Multi-Modal Context Capture Strategy

PostToolUse hooks should implement tiered context capture:

**Tier 1: Immediate Context (< 1KB)**
- Command success/failure status
- Key metrics or results
- Error classifications
- Next recommended actions

**Tier 2: Detailed Context (< 10KB)**
- Full structured output
- Performance benchmarks
- State changes detected
- Integration points affected

**Tier 3: Archaeological Context (Unlimited)**
- Complete raw output
- Environmental state snapshots
- Dependency analysis
- Historical pattern matching

### 3. Context Intelligence Layer

The PostToolUse hook should include an AI-powered context processor that:

1. **Categorizes Output**: Build/test/deploy/analysis/debug classifications
2. **Extracts Actionables**: TODOs, blockers, dependencies identified
3. **Creates Summaries**: Human-readable context for next agent
4. **Indexes Knowledge**: Searchable context database for future reference

## Proposed Implementation Architecture

```typescript
interface PostToolUseContext {
  commandFingerprint: string;  // Hash of command + env state
  executionContext: {
    workingDirectory: string;
    environmentHash: string;
    timestampUtc: string;
    agentSession: string;
  };
  results: {
    immediate: ImmediateContext;
    detailed: DetailedContext;
    archaeological: ArchaeologicalContext;
  };
  intelligence: {
    classification: CommandType;
    extractedActionables: Actionable[];
    nextStepsSuggested: string[];
    contextSummary: string;
  };
}
```

## Context Retrieval Strategy

### Intelligent Context Matching

Rather than simple command caching, implement **semantic command matching**:

- **Intent Recognition**: Match similar commands with different parameters
- **Context Similarity**: Find related previous executions
- **State-Aware Retrieval**: Consider environmental changes since last execution

### Agent Briefing Protocol

When new agents are activated:

1. **Context Inheritance**: Receive curated context package from previous agent
2. **Knowledge Query Interface**: Allow agents to search historical context
3. **Context Validation**: Verify context relevance before using cached results

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Context Freshness Validation

Cached context must include staleness indicators:
- File modification timestamps
- Dependency version changes
- Environmental state drift
- Explicit invalidation triggers

### 2. Cross-Agent Context Handoffs

Context must survive agent transitions:
- Standardized context formats
- Version-controlled context evolution
- Context compression for long-running projects
- Context archaeology for debugging

### 3. Context Conflict Resolution

When multiple agents modify shared context:
- Context merge strategies
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Manual resolution prompts
- Context rollback capabilities

## Proposed Voting Options

**Option A: Hybrid Context Architecture**
- Immediate PostToolUse capture with intelligent context processing
- Tiered storage with automatic context degradation
- Agent-aware context briefing system

**Option B: Pure Context Substitution**
- Replace all command re-execution with context retrieval
- Aggressive context caching with semantic matching
- Context-first decision making for all agents

**Option C: Adaptive Context Strategy**
- Context complexity scales with command importance
- Agent-specific context preferences
- Dynamic context freshness validation

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**: Context staleness leading to incorrect decisions
**Medium Risk**: Context storage bloat affecting performance
**Low Risk**: Agent confusion from over-contextualization

## Recommendation

Implement **Option A** with emphasis on context intelligence and agent handoff protocols. The goal should be building a persistent knowledge layer that makes future agents smarter, not just preventing command re-execution.

# problem-statement.md
# Problem Statement: PostToolUse Hook Strategy for Claude Auto-Tee

## Context and Background

The claude-auto-tee tool successfully captures full command output by injecting `tee` into piped bash commands via a PreToolUse hook. However, ensuring Claude reliably uses the captured output instead of re-running commands remains challenging.

**Critical New Information**: Claude Code supports both PreToolUse AND PostToolUse hooks. The PostToolUse hook:
- Runs immediately after a tool completes successfully
- Receives the complete tool response including stdout/stderr
- Can process, store, or modify information after execution
- Receives JSON with `tool_response` containing all output

This fundamentally changes the solution space from our previous debate, which incorrectly assumed only PreToolUse hooks existed.

## Current Implementation

**PreToolUse Hook**: 
- Detects pipes in bash commands
- Injects `tee /tmp/claude-xyz.log` to capture full output
- Outputs "Full output saved to: /tmp/claude-xyz.log" to stderr

**Problem**: Claude must parse this stderr message, extract the path, and remember it - unreliable process with ~10% failure rate.

## Specific Decision Points

1. **PostToolUse Integration**: How should the PostToolUse hook process and store capture information?
2. **Communication Protocol**: What's the most reliable way to inform Claude about captures?
3. **State Management**: Where and how should capture metadata be persisted?
4. **Discovery Mechanism**: How should Claude query/discover available captures?
5. **Context Injection**: Can PostToolUse modify Claude's context or only store data?
6. **Coordination**: How should PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks work together?

## Success Criteria

- **100% Awareness**: Claude must ALWAYS know when output was captured
- **Zero Re-runs**: Eliminate unnecessary command re-execution
- **Automatic Discovery**: Claude should automatically find captures without manual intervention
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Captures should be discoverable across tool invocations
- **Minimal Complexity**: Solution should be simple and maintainable
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if hooks fail

## Constraints and Requirements

- Must work within Claude Code's hook architecture
- PostToolUse receives JSON with tool_response but cannot modify Claude's memory directly
- Must handle concurrent captures from multiple commands
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows via WSL)
- Cannot modify Claude Code core or Claude's internal behavior
- Must coordinate between PreToolUse (injection) and PostToolUse (notification)

## Key Technical Capabilities

**PostToolUse Hook Receives**:
```json
{
  "session_id": "...",
  "transcript_path": "...",
  "cwd": "...",
  "hook_event_name": "PostToolUse",
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {"command": "..."},
  "tool_response": {
    "stdout": "...",
    "stderr": "...",
    "exit_code": 0
  }
}
```

The hook can:
- Parse the tool_response to extract capture file paths
- Write structured data to persistent storage
- Create marker files or registries
- Set environment variables for future commands
- Generate summaries or indexes

## Critical Question

Given that PostToolUse hooks CAN process the complete tool response AFTER execution, what is the optimal strategy to ensure Claude will ALWAYS use captured output from tee injections rather than re-running commands?

# round-1/expert-001.md
# Expert 001: Round 1 Response

## My Perspective

After analyzing all opening statements, I maintain that **system boundary design** remains the critical foundation, but acknowledge that my colleagues have identified essential layers that must be built on top of this foundation.

**Expert 002's context injection** and **Expert 004's cognitive optimization** address the crucial "last mile" problem - even with perfect capture persistence, Claude must still be made aware of available outputs in a cognitively optimal way. This reinforces my registry approach but suggests the PostToolUse hook should also generate **immediate context injections** alongside persistent storage.

**Expert 003's state management concerns** validate my emphasis on atomic capture and failure isolation, but their pure PostToolUse approach may be too aggressive. We still need fallback mechanisms for edge cases where the registry approach fails.

**Expert 005's context intelligence layer** represents valuable enhancement, but adds significant complexity. While semantic understanding is desirable, we should prioritize getting basic structured capture working reliably first.

**Refined Position**: The optimal strategy combines:
1. **Structured registry persistence** (my core position)
2. **Immediate context injection** (Expert 002/004 insights)  
3. **Graceful degradation** to address Expert 003's reliability concerns

The PostToolUse hook should:
- Parse `tool_response.stderr` for capture file paths
- Update persistent JSON registry with metadata
- Generate formatted context blocks appended to tool output
- Set environment variables for immediate discoverability

This creates **multiple communication channels** ensuring Claude receives capture information even if individual channels fail:
- Visual context blocks (immediate awareness)
- Environment variables (session persistence)
- JSON registry (cross-session continuity)

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: YES

**Reason**: Critical implementation details remain unresolved. We need to address Expert 003's concerns about cache invalidation, Expert 002's context window optimization, and define specific formats for Expert 004's context injection strategy. The approaches are complementary but require integration design.

## Proposed Voting Options

- **Option A**: Multi-Channel Architecture - Registry + Context Injection + Environment Variables
- **Option B**: Pure Context Injection - Focus on Expert 004's cognitive optimization approach  
- **Option C**: Staged Implementation - Start with registry, add context injection in phase 2
- **Option D**: Hybrid State Management - Expert 003's approach with registry fallback
- **Option E**: Context Intelligence - Expert 005's AI-powered context processing layer

# round-1/expert-002.md
# Expert 002: Round 1 Response

## My Perspective

After reviewing all opening statements, I maintain that the optimal strategy lies in **proactive context injection with intelligent semantic enhancement**. However, the other experts have highlighted critical architectural considerations that strengthen my position.

Expert 001's system boundaries analysis confirms my core thesis: the current stderr parsing approach creates **lossy communication channels** that violate proper system design. Their registry architecture proposal aligns perfectly with my context-aware approach - we need structured persistence, not message passing.

Expert 003's state management concerns about operational reliability are valid, but I believe they underestimate the importance of **making captured data feel native to Claude's reasoning process**. Pure state management without cognitive optimization will still result in Claude preferring re-execution over cached lookups.

Expert 004's AI systems perspective is particularly compelling and validates my approach to **cognitive load optimization**. Their context injection strategy with formatted metadata blocks directly supports my proactive injection pattern. However, I propose we go further - don't just inject metadata, inject **semantically enhanced summaries**.

Expert 005's context management strategy introduces valuable concepts around **multi-modal context capture** and **agent handoff efficiency**. Their tiered context approach (Immediate/Detailed/Archaeological) could be integrated into my semantic enhancement framework.

**My enhanced position**: PostToolUse hooks should implement a **three-phase strategy**:

1. **Immediate Semantic Processing**: Extract key insights, error patterns, and success indicators from raw output
2. **Context-Aware Injection**: Append formatted, actionable summaries directly to tool responses using Expert 004's visual formatting principles
3. **Intelligent Registry**: Maintain Expert 001's structured registry enhanced with semantic metadata for cross-session discovery

The key insight missing from other approaches is that **Claude must perceive captured output as more valuable than re-execution**. This requires making the captured data:
- More immediately accessible (proactive injection)
- More cognitively digestible (semantic enhancement)
- More contextually relevant (task-aware summarization)

Raw output storage, no matter how well architected, still requires Claude to actively choose cached data over the immediate gratification of re-running commands. We must **remove that choice** by making cached output obviously superior.

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: YES

**Reason**: The opening statements reveal complementary strengths that could be synthesized into a more robust solution. Expert 001's system architecture + Expert 004's cognitive optimization + my semantic enhancement could create an optimal hybrid approach. We need to resolve the tension between comprehensive state management vs focused context injection.

## Proposed Voting Options

Based on the synthesis of all positions:

- **Option A**: Hybrid Semantic Registry - Structured persistence (Expert 001) + Proactive context injection (Expert 004) + Semantic enhancement (Expert 002) + Multi-tiered storage (Expert 005)

- **Option B**: Pure Context Injection - Focus entirely on making captured output irresistibly accessible through enhanced formatting and semantic processing, minimal state management overhead

- **Option C**: Adaptive Intelligence - PostToolUse hooks dynamically choose between simple caching vs full semantic processing based on command type and execution context

The debate should focus on finding the optimal balance between architectural robustness and cognitive accessibility.

# round-1/expert-003.md
# Expert 003 - Round 1 Response

## My Perspective

Having reviewed all opening statements, I maintain my position on **Pure PostToolUse Architecture** but acknowledge the compelling arguments from other experts that require strategic synthesis.

### Convergence on Core Problems

All experts correctly identify that the current stderr parsing approach is fundamentally flawed - Expert 001's "boundary crossing anti-pattern," Expert 002's "cognitive load reduction" needs, Expert 004's "fragile cognitive dependency," and Expert 005's "context continuity" requirements all point to the same underlying issue: **we're solving the wrong problem**.

### Critical Insight: State vs Context Distinction

Expert 005's distinction between raw output capture and context intelligence is crucial. However, I disagree with their complexity assessment. From an operational reliability perspective, we must distinguish between:

1. **Immediate State Capture** (what I advocated): Atomic, reliable storage of tool responses
2. **Context Intelligence Layer** (Expert 005's vision): AI-powered semantic processing

These should be **decoupled concerns**. Attempting to solve both simultaneously introduces failure modes that compromise the primary goal of preventing command re-execution.

### Synthesis Position: Staged Reliability-First Approach

After analyzing all perspectives, I propose a modified approach that maintains operational reliability while acknowledging context management needs:

**Phase 1: Bulletproof State Capture**
- Pure PostToolUse architecture with central state store (my original position)
- Expert 004's context injection formatting for immediate visibility
- Expert 001's registry persistence for cross-session reliability

**Phase 2: Context Intelligence Integration**
- Expert 002's semantic metadata enhancement
- Expert 005's tiered context storage
- Intelligent caching with command fingerprinting

### Why Reliability Must Come First

Expert 002's "context pollution" risk and Expert 005's "context staleness" concerns are valid, but they're **secondary problems**. The primary operational requirement is preventing costly command re-execution. A simple, reliable state capture mechanism that works 99.9% of the time is preferable to a sophisticated context intelligence system that works 85% of the time.

### Strategic Implementation Recommendation

I support Expert 004's **Context Injection Strategy** as the optimal immediate solution, with the following reliability enhancements:

1. **Atomic Capture**: PostToolUse hook captures complete tool response to persistent store
2. **Immediate Injection**: Expert 004's formatted context blocks appended to output
3. **Persistent Registry**: Expert 001's JSON registry for session boundaries
4. **Graceful Degradation**: If context injection fails, registry lookup remains available

This approach satisfies Expert 002's "proactive context injection" while maintaining the operational reliability I prioritize.

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: YES

**Reason**: The convergence on context injection is promising, but we need to resolve the tension between operational reliability and context intelligence complexity. Expert 005's vision is compelling but may introduce failure modes that compromise the primary goal.

## Proposed Voting Options

Based on synthesis of all positions:

- **Option A**: Reliability-First Context Injection (Context blocks + persistent registry + graceful degradation)
- **Option B**: Intelligence-First Context Management (AI-powered semantic processing + tiered storage)
- **Option C**: Hybrid Staged Implementation (Phase 1 reliability, Phase 2 intelligence)
- **Option D**: Minimal Viable Context (Environment variables + simple formatting only)

# round-1/expert-004.md
# Expert 004: Round 1 Response

## My Perspective

After analyzing all opening statements, I maintain that the optimal approach requires **immediate context injection with cognitive optimization principles**. However, I now see that my initial focus on information presentation must integrate with the broader system architecture concerns raised by other experts.

### Synthesis of Critical Insights

**Expert 001's Registry Architecture** provides the persistence layer needed for cross-session reliability, but it still requires Claude to actively query the registry. This creates the same cognitive burden I identified in my opening statement.

**Expert 002's Context Injection** aligns closely with my approach but focuses on semantic enhancement rather than cognitive load optimization. The "shadow response pattern" is brilliant but needs stronger visual formatting to ensure Claude reliably processes the injected context.

**Expert 003's State Management** correctly identifies that PostToolUse eliminates failure vectors, but the proposed "intelligent suggestion" still relies on Claude making discovery decisions rather than having information presented systematically.

**Expert 005's Context Intelligence** introduces crucial semantic processing but may over-engineer the initial solution. The tiered context approach is valuable but should be implemented progressively.

### Refined Strategy: Hybrid Context Architecture

I propose combining the strongest elements from each approach:

**1. Immediate Visual Context Injection (My Core Contribution)**

📊 SUMMARY: 27 tests passed, coverage 89%
🎯 ACTION: Use Read tool with path above for full details

```

**2. Registry Persistence Layer (Expert 001)**
- JSON registry maintains structured metadata
- Environment variables for immediate access
- Cross-session discovery capabilities

**3. Semantic Enhancement (Expert 002)**
- Pre-parsed error classifications
- Key metrics extraction
- Context-aware summaries

### Why This Hybrid Approach Optimizes AI Cognitive Patterns

The visual context injection addresses the fundamental issue: **Claude must see capture information without having to discover it**. The registry provides reliability, semantic enhancement adds intelligence, but the visual formatting ensures cognitive processing happens automatically.

### Critical Implementation Detail

The PostToolUse hook must **append formatted context blocks directly to the tool response** that Claude receives. This is different from environment variables or separate files - it guarantees visibility within Claude's immediate working context.

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: YES

**Reason**: We need to reconcile the technical architecture differences between immediate injection (my approach + Expert 002) versus persistent discovery (Expert 001 + Expert 003). Expert 005's context intelligence adds complexity that requires careful integration planning.

## Proposed Voting Options

- **Option A**: Hybrid Context Architecture - Visual injection + Registry persistence + Semantic enhancement
- **Option B**: Pure Injection Strategy - Focus solely on immediate context formatting with minimal infrastructure
- **Option C**: Registry-First with Enhanced Presentation - Expert 001's architecture with improved Claude-facing interfaces
- **Option D**: Staged Implementation - Start with visual injection, add registry and intelligence layers progressively

The debate should focus on whether cognitive optimization (immediate injection) or system reliability (persistent registry) takes priority in the initial implementation.

# round-1/expert-005.md
# Expert 005: Round 1 Response - Context Management Strategy

## My Perspective

After reviewing all opening statements, I see a convergence toward structured data persistence, but I want to emphasize the **context lifecycle management** aspect that hasn't been fully addressed by other experts.

### Building on Collective Insights

Expert 001's registry architecture provides the foundational infrastructure we need, but requires context-aware enhancement. Expert 002's context injection approach is crucial for immediate Claude awareness. Expert 003's state management focus correctly identifies operational reliability concerns. Expert 004's cognitive load optimization insights are essential for usable implementation.

However, all approaches still treat captured output as static data rather than **living context** that evolves and degrades over time.

### My Enhanced Position: Dynamic Context Lifecycle Management

The PostToolUse hook should implement **temporal context intelligence**:

```typescript
interface ContextLifecycle {
  capturePhase: "immediate" | "processed" | "archived";
  freshness: {
    capturedAt: Date;
    environmentSnapshot: string;
    validityWindow: number;
    stalenessIndicators: string[];
  };
  evolution: {
    subsequentCommands: string[];
    stateChanges: FileSystemChange[];
    contextInvalidations: InvalidationEvent[];
  };
}
```

### Critical Gap: Context Dependency Tracking

Current proposals miss the **dependency web** between commands. For example:
- `npm test` output becomes stale after `package.json` changes
- `git status` output invalidates after any git operation
- Build outputs depend on source code modifications

PostToolUse hooks should track these dependencies and proactively invalidate related contexts.

### Integration with Expert Proposals

**Combining Expert 001's registry + Expert 004's injection pattern:**
- Registry stores full context lifecycle data
- Injection pattern includes freshness warnings
- Environment variables indicate context staleness levels

**Enhancing Expert 002's context injection:**
- Add temporal metadata to injected context
- Include dependency change warnings
- Provide context confidence scores

**Building on Expert 003's state management:**
- State store includes context evolution tracking
- Automatic invalidation based on dependency changes
- Graceful degradation when context becomes stale

### Proposed Technical Enhancement

```bash
# PostToolUse hook workflow
1. Capture raw output (all experts agree)
2. Extract semantic meaning from output
3. Identify context dependencies (files, state, environment)
4. Calculate context validity window
5. Store with lifecycle metadata
6. Inject immediate context with freshness indicators
7. Schedule background staleness monitoring
```

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: YES

**Reason**: While we have strong consensus on infrastructure (registry + injection), we need to resolve the critical issue of **context lifecycle management**. None of the current proposals adequately address how to prevent stale context from misleading Claude, which could be worse than re-execution.

Key unresolved questions:
1. How do we detect when cached context becomes unreliable?
2. What's the right balance between context persistence and freshness validation?
3. How should Claude be warned about potentially stale context?

## Proposed Voting Options

Based on synthesis of all expert input:

**Option A: Lifecycle-Aware Registry System**
- Expert 001's registry + context dependency tracking
- Automatic staleness detection and warnings
- Expert 004's injection with freshness indicators

**Option B: Confidence-Scored Context Injection**
- Expert 002's context injection + confidence scoring
- Real-time freshness validation before injection
- Graceful degradation to re-execution when confidence is low

**Option C: Hybrid Temporal Context Architecture**
- Immediate context (always fresh) + archived context (potentially stale)
- Context evolution tracking with dependency invalidation
- Agent-specific context confidence thresholds

We need another round to reconcile context persistence benefits with freshness reliability concerns.

# round-2/expert-001.md
# Expert 001: Round 2 Response

## My Perspective

After analyzing all Round 1 responses, I see remarkable convergence on the fundamental architecture but critical divergence on implementation priorities. My system boundary analysis remains the foundation, but the other experts have revealed essential layers that transform my registry from static storage into a dynamic, intelligent system.

**Expert 005's context lifecycle management** addresses the most critical gap in my original proposal. A registry without temporal intelligence becomes a liability - stale context can mislead Claude more than no context at all. Their dependency tracking insight is brilliant: `npm test` output must invalidate when `package.json` changes. This transforms my static JSON registry into a **dependency-aware state machine**.

**Expert 002's semantic enhancement** and **Expert 004's cognitive optimization** solve the "last mile" problem I identified but didn't fully address. Even with perfect registry architecture, Claude must still choose to use cached data. Their combined approach - immediate visual injection with semantic processing - removes that choice by making cached output obviously superior to re-execution.

**Expert 003's reliability-first staging** provides the practical implementation path. Their distinction between immediate state capture (operational requirement) and context intelligence (enhancement) is architecturally sound. We can't sacrifice core reliability for advanced features.

**Refined System Architecture:**

The PostToolUse hook should implement a **three-tier hybrid system**:

1. **Immediate Capture Layer** (Expert 003's reliability focus)
   - Atomic storage to persistent registry 
   - Fail-safe environment variable fallback
   - Zero dependency on complex processing

2. **Context Intelligence Layer** (Expert 005's lifecycle + Expert 002's semantics)
   - Dependency tracking and staleness detection
   - Semantic extraction with confidence scoring
   - Automatic invalidation triggers

3. **Presentation Layer** (Expert 004's cognitive optimization)
   - Visual context blocks with freshness indicators
   - Direct injection into tool responses
   - Graduated warnings for stale context

**Critical Implementation Insight:** The registry becomes a **living dependency graph**, not static storage. Each capture includes:
- Raw output (reliability baseline)
- Dependency fingerprints (invalidation triggers)  
- Semantic metadata (cognitive optimization)
- Temporal markers (freshness validation)

This addresses Expert 005's staleness concerns while maintaining Expert 003's reliability requirements and Expert 004's cognitive accessibility.

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: NO

**Reason**: We've achieved architectural consensus on the hybrid approach combining registry persistence, context intelligence, and immediate injection. The implementation details (dependency tracking algorithms, staleness thresholds, injection formatting) are technical rather than strategic decisions. We're ready to move to final voting on the specific architectural approach.

## Proposed Voting Options

- **Option A**: Three-Tier Hybrid System - Registry + Context Intelligence + Visual Injection with staged reliability-first implementation
- **Option B**: Simplified Context Injection - Focus on Expert 004's immediate injection with basic persistence, defer intelligence layer
- **Option C**: Registry-Centric with Intelligence - Enhanced registry with Expert 005's lifecycle management, simpler presentation layer
- **Option D**: Lifecycle-First Architecture - Expert 005's dependency tracking as primary architecture with registry and injection as supporting systems

# round-2/expert-002.md
# Expert 002: Round 2 Response

## My Perspective

After reviewing Round 1 responses, I'm struck by the remarkable convergence around **context injection as the core solution** - Expert 001's "immediate context injections," Expert 003's acknowledgment of "context injection strategy," Expert 004's "immediate visual context injection," and Expert 005's "context injection approach." This validates my original thesis that proactive context delivery is essential.

However, Expert 005's **context lifecycle management** concerns have fundamentally shifted my thinking. My Round 1 focus on "semantic enhancement" was correct but incomplete - we need **adaptive context intelligence** that considers temporal validity.

### Enhanced Synthesis Position: Intelligent Context Orchestration

The debate has revealed three distinct but complementary layers:

1. **Infrastructure Layer** (Expert 001): Registry persistence for reliability
2. **Presentation Layer** (Expert 004): Visual formatting for cognitive optimization  
3. **Intelligence Layer** (My contribution + Expert 005): Semantic processing with lifecycle awareness

My refined approach combines these into **intelligent context orchestration**:

```typescript
interface IntelligentContextInjection {
  immediate: {
    visualBlock: FormattedContextBlock;    // Expert 004's visual approach
    semanticSummary: ContextSummary;       // My semantic enhancement
    freshnessScore: ConfidenceMetric;      // Expert 005's lifecycle awareness
  };
  persistent: {
    registryEntry: StructuredMetadata;     // Expert 001's architecture
    stateSnapshot: EnvironmentCapture;     // Expert 003's reliability focus
    dependencyGraph: ContextRelations;     // Expert 005's dependency tracking
  };
}
```

### Critical Insight: Context as Competitive Advantage

Expert 005's dependency tracking reveals the key: **captured context must be objectively superior to re-execution**. This isn't just about convenience - it's about providing Claude with enhanced intelligence that fresh execution cannot match.

Consider these enhanced context scenarios:
- **Historical Comparison**: "Test coverage improved from 85% → 89% since last run"
- **Dependency Awareness**: "Warning: package.json modified since this test output was captured"
- **Pattern Recognition**: "This error pattern matches 3 previous builds, likely configuration issue"

### Resolving the Freshness vs. Reliability Tension

Expert 003's reliability concerns and Expert 005's staleness warnings can be reconciled through **graduated context confidence**:

```
HIGH CONFIDENCE (Fresh + Validated)
└─ Full context injection with enhancement
MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (Recent + Dependencies stable) 
└─ Context injection with staleness warnings
LOW CONFIDENCE (Stale + Dependencies changed)
└─ Registry availability notice + re-execution suggestion
```

This addresses Expert 003's "99.9% reliability" requirement while incorporating Expert 005's lifecycle intelligence.

### Integration with Existing Architecture

Expert 001's multi-channel approach (registry + environment variables + context blocks) provides the perfect foundation for this enhanced intelligence. Expert 004's visual formatting ensures cognitive processing, while my semantic enhancement makes the captured context genuinely superior to fresh execution.

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: NO

**Reason**: The Round 1 discussion has achieved remarkable synthesis - all experts now support context injection with complementary architectural elements. Expert 005's lifecycle management insight provides the missing piece to resolve freshness concerns. The approaches are now complementary rather than competing. We should proceed to finals to choose between graduated implementations rather than fundamental architectures.

## Proposed Voting Options

Based on complete synthesis of all expert positions:

- **Option A**: Graduated Intelligence Context System - Full integration of all expert approaches with confidence-based delivery
- **Option B**: Reliability-First Context Injection - Expert 003's staged approach with Expert 004's visual formatting  
- **Option C**: Minimal Viable Context Intelligence - Core context injection with registry backup, minimal lifecycle complexity
- **Option D**: Pure Visual Context Strategy - Expert 004's immediate injection approach without persistent architecture overhead

The synthesis is strong enough to proceed to final voting on implementation priorities rather than architectural fundamentals.

# round-2/expert-003.md
# Expert 003: Round 2 Response

## My Perspective

After reviewing the Round 1 synthesis, I see strong convergence on the hybrid architecture concept, but I remain concerned about **operational complexity creep**. The debate has evolved from "how to ensure Claude uses captured output" to "how to build an intelligent context management system" - we're solving increasingly sophisticated problems while the core reliability issue remains unaddressed.

### Critical Analysis of Round 1 Synthesis

**Expert 001's Multi-Channel Architecture** correctly identifies that we need redundant communication pathways, but introduces multiple failure points. Each additional channel (environment variables, JSON registry, context injection) creates new operational overhead and potential inconsistency states.

**Expert 002's Three-Phase Strategy** with semantic processing is intellectually compelling but operationally risky. The "semantic enhancement" and "task-aware summarization" phases introduce AI-dependent processing that could fail or introduce latency when Claude needs immediate access to captured output.

**Expert 004's Hybrid Context Architecture** with visual formatting addresses the cognitive optimization need, but the proposed format block is fragile - if the PostToolUse hook fails to generate it correctly, Claude has no fallback mechanism.

**Expert 005's Context Lifecycle Management** identifies crucial real-world concerns about data freshness, but the proposed dependency tracking system is significantly more complex than the original problem warrants.

### My Refined Position: Operational Reliability Through Defensive Design

Based on the synthesis, I propose a **defense-in-depth approach** that prioritizes operational reliability while incorporating the cognitive optimization insights:

**Layer 1: Atomic State Persistence** (My core position - unchanged)
- PostToolUse hook writes captured output to predictable file paths
- Zero external dependencies, minimal failure surface
- Always works regardless of context complexity

**Layer 2: Immediate Context Visibility** (Expert 004's insight)
- Simple, structured message appended directly to tool output
- Fixed format to prevent parsing failures
- Degrades gracefully if formatting fails

**Layer 3: Cross-Session Discovery** (Expert 001's registry)
- JSON registry for persistent state across sessions
- Only activated if Layer 1 succeeds
- No semantic processing dependencies

### The Critical Insight: Simplicity Enables Reliability

The Round 1 discussion reveals a pattern where each expert's sophistication improvements introduce new failure modes:

- Semantic processing can fail or misinterpret output
- Dependency tracking requires perfect state monitoring
- Context confidence scoring needs AI inference
- Visual formatting depends on consistent message structure

My operational experience suggests that **the more sophisticated the context management becomes, the less reliable it will be when Claude actually needs it**.

### Proposed Implementation Strategy

```bash
# PostToolUse Hook - Defensive Implementation
1. ALWAYS capture raw output to predictable path (cannot fail)
2. IF formatting succeeds, append simple context block
3. IF registry write succeeds, update cross-session state
4. IF semantic processing available, enhance stored context
```

This ensures Claude always has access to captured data through Layer 1, with additional convenience layers that can fail without compromising core functionality.

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: NO

**Reason**: The Round 1 synthesis demonstrates strong architectural consensus with manageable complexity differences. Expert 004's context injection + Expert 001's registry persistence + my defensive implementation approach provides a robust foundation. Expert 005's temporal concerns can be addressed in post-implementation enhancement phases.

The debate has reached diminishing returns - further discussion risks over-engineering the solution before we validate whether the basic hybrid approach actually solves Claude's usage patterns.

## Proposed Voting Options

Based on operational reliability priorities:

- **Option A**: Defensive Hybrid - Layer 1 atomic capture + Layer 2 context injection + Layer 3 registry fallback with graceful degradation at each layer

- **Option B**: Reliability-First Minimal - Focus purely on atomic state capture with simple context formatting, defer registry and semantic enhancement to Phase 2

- **Option C**: Context-Optimized Hybrid - Expert 004's visual injection + Expert 001's registry with Expert 005's freshness warnings, accepting higher complexity for better Claude UX

The choice should depend on our risk tolerance for system complexity versus Claude optimization benefits.

# round-2/expert-004.md
# Expert 004: Round 2 Response

## My Perspective

After reviewing Round 1 responses, I see strong convergence toward **hybrid architecture combining immediate injection with persistent storage**, but we're over-engineering the solution. The collective discussion has validated my core thesis while revealing critical implementation priorities.

### Key Convergences That Strengthen My Position

**Expert 001's "Multiple Communication Channels"** directly validates my cognitive optimization approach - we need redundant pathways to ensure Claude receives capture information. Their registry + environment variables + context blocks strategy is exactly right.

**Expert 002's "Making Captured Output Irresistibly Accessible"** captures the essential insight. However, their semantic enhancement approach, while valuable, introduces complexity that could delay implementation. My visual formatting achieves 80% of the benefit with 20% of the complexity.

**Expert 003's "Reliability-First Context Injection"** correctly identifies that operational reliability must precede intelligence features. Their staged approach validates my preference for simple, immediate solutions that work consistently.

**Expert 005's Context Lifecycle Management** raises important questions about staleness, but their dependency tracking system is sophisticated beyond our immediate needs. We're solving for Claude re-running `npm test` unnecessarily, not building a comprehensive build system.

### Refined Strategy: Minimum Viable Cognitive Optimization

Based on all Round 1 input, the optimal approach is:

**1. Visual Context Injection (Immediate)**
```
═══════ CLAUDE-AUTO-TEE CAPTURE ═══════
📁 FILE: /tmp/claude-capture-abc123.log
⚡ CMD: npm test --coverage
✅ EXIT: 0 (Success)

```

**2. Environment Variable Bridge (Session)**
```bash
export CLAUDE_LAST_CAPTURE="/tmp/claude-capture-abc123.log"

```

**3. Simple JSON Registry (Persistence)**
```json

  "latest_capture": "/tmp/claude-capture-abc123.log",
  "command": "npm test --coverage",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:23:15Z",
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

### Why This Approach Optimizes for AI Cognitive Patterns

The visual injection leverages Claude's pattern recognition for:
- **Immediate visibility** - no discovery required
- **Action-oriented formatting** - tells Claude exactly what to do
- **Status clarity** - success/failure immediately apparent
- **File path prominence** - the most critical information is highlighted

Expert 002's semantic enhancement and Expert 005's lifecycle management are valuable but should be **Phase 2 features**. The primary goal is stopping unnecessary re-execution, not building perfect context intelligence.

### Critical Implementation Insight

The PostToolUse hook must **modify the tool response object** that Claude receives, not just store data externally. This is the key difference between discovery-based approaches (which still require Claude to actively find information) and cognitive optimization (which presents information automatically).

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: NO

**Reason**: We have sufficient convergence on the hybrid approach (visual injection + registry + environment variables). Further debate risks over-engineering what should be a simple solution. The core architecture is clear - implementation details can be resolved during development.

## Proposed Voting Options

- **Option A**: Minimum Viable Hybrid - Visual injection + environment variables + simple JSON registry (my refined position)
- **Option B**: Registry-First Architecture - Expert 001's comprehensive approach with visual enhancement
- **Option C**: Semantic-Enhanced Injection - Expert 002's context intelligence with simplified implementation
- **Option D**: Staged Reliability Implementation - Expert 003's phased approach starting with basic state capture

The debate has served its purpose. Time to build and validate through real-world testing rather than theoretical discussion.

# round-2/expert-005.md
# Expert 005: Round 2 Response

## My Perspective

After reviewing the Round 1 responses, I see remarkable convergence on the need for **hybrid architecture combining registry persistence with immediate context injection**, but we're still missing the critical temporal dimension that will determine long-term system reliability.

### Validation of My Context Lifecycle Thesis

The Round 1 responses validate my core concern about **context staleness**:

- **Expert 001** acknowledges the need for "multiple communication channels" but doesn't address when those channels deliver outdated information
- **Expert 002** correctly identifies that "Claude must perceive captured output as more valuable than re-execution" but this breaks down when captured output becomes misleading due to staleness  
- **Expert 003** emphasizes "operational reliability" but proposes no mechanism to detect when cached state no longer reflects system reality
- **Expert 004** focuses on "cognitive load optimization" but optimizing presentation of stale context creates worse cognitive overhead than re-execution

### The Missing Infrastructure Layer: Context Dependency Graphs

All experts converge on structured storage + context injection, but ignore the **dependency invalidation problem**. Consider this scenario:

1. Claude runs `npm test` → captures success output
2. Developer modifies `package.json` 
3. PostToolUse hook injects "previous test success" context
4. Claude proceeds with confidence in test results that are now invalid

This is worse than re-execution because it creates **false confidence in stale state**.

### Refined Position: Temporal-Aware Hybrid Architecture

Building on the Round 1 convergence, I propose enhancing the hybrid approach with **context dependency tracking**:

**Immediate Layer (Expert 004's injection + freshness validation):**

**Intelligence Layer (Expert 002's semantic enhancement + staleness detection):**
- Background monitoring of dependency files
- Automatic context invalidation when dependencies change
- Confidence scoring based on temporal distance and dependency stability

### Critical Implementation Insight

The PostToolUse hook must implement **bidirectional temporal awareness**:

1. **Forward-looking**: Track what system state the captured output depends on
2. **Backward-looking**: Monitor how system state has changed since capture
3. **Present-moment**: Calculate context reliability score for injection decisions

This addresses Expert 003's reliability concerns while maintaining Expert 004's cognitive optimization and Expert 002's semantic intelligence.

## Extension Vote

**Continue Debate**: NO

**Reason**: We've achieved sufficient convergence on hybrid architecture (registry + injection + semantic enhancement). The temporal dependency layer I'm proposing can be integrated into any of the hybrid approaches from Round 1. The core debate question has been resolved - we need structured capture with immediate injection and persistent storage. Implementation details can be refined during development.

## Proposed Voting Options

Based on Round 1 convergence and temporal enhancement needs:

- **Option A**: Temporal-Aware Hybrid (Registry + Injection + Dependency Tracking + Freshness Validation)
- **Option B**: Simple Hybrid with Manual Freshness (Registry + Injection + User-initiated cache invalidation)  
- **Option C**: Adaptive Context Intelligence (Dynamic switching between cached/fresh based on confidence scoring)
- **Option D**: Staged Implementation (Phase 1: Basic hybrid, Phase 2: Temporal intelligence)

All options include the Round 1 consensus elements (structured registry + immediate context injection + semantic metadata). The choice is about temporal intelligence complexity vs implementation simplicity.
