# Expert 005 Opening Statement: Context Management Strategy

## Executive Summary

From a context management perspective, PostToolUse hooks represent a paradigm shift from reactive output capture to proactive knowledge persistence. The optimal strategy must prioritize **context continuity** and **agent handoff efficiency** over traditional output redirection.

## Core Position: Context-First Architecture

### 1. Context Persistence as Primary Goal

The fundamental issue isn't just preventing command re-executionâ€”it's ensuring that **context survives agent transitions**. PostToolUse hooks should create a persistent knowledge layer that transcends individual command outputs:

- **Structured Context Storage**: Raw stdout/stderr is insufficient. We need semantic understanding of what each command accomplished
- **Agent Memory Continuity**: Each agent handoff should include curated context, not just raw logs
- **Decision Trail Preservation**: Capture not just what happened, but why decisions were made

### 2. Multi-Modal Context Capture Strategy

PostToolUse hooks should implement tiered context capture:

**Tier 1: Immediate Context (< 1KB)**
- Command success/failure status
- Key metrics or results
- Error classifications
- Next recommended actions

**Tier 2: Detailed Context (< 10KB)**
- Full structured output
- Performance benchmarks
- State changes detected
- Integration points affected

**Tier 3: Archaeological Context (Unlimited)**
- Complete raw output
- Environmental state snapshots
- Dependency analysis
- Historical pattern matching

### 3. Context Intelligence Layer

The PostToolUse hook should include an AI-powered context processor that:

1. **Categorizes Output**: Build/test/deploy/analysis/debug classifications
2. **Extracts Actionables**: TODOs, blockers, dependencies identified
3. **Creates Summaries**: Human-readable context for next agent
4. **Indexes Knowledge**: Searchable context database for future reference

## Proposed Implementation Architecture

```typescript
interface PostToolUseContext {
  commandFingerprint: string;  // Hash of command + env state
  executionContext: {
    workingDirectory: string;
    environmentHash: string;
    timestampUtc: string;
    agentSession: string;
  };
  results: {
    immediate: ImmediateContext;
    detailed: DetailedContext;
    archaeological: ArchaeologicalContext;
  };
  intelligence: {
    classification: CommandType;
    extractedActionables: Actionable[];
    nextStepsSuggested: string[];
    contextSummary: string;
  };
}
```

## Context Retrieval Strategy

### Intelligent Context Matching

Rather than simple command caching, implement **semantic command matching**:

- **Intent Recognition**: Match similar commands with different parameters
- **Context Similarity**: Find related previous executions
- **State-Aware Retrieval**: Consider environmental changes since last execution

### Agent Briefing Protocol

When new agents are activated:

1. **Context Inheritance**: Receive curated context package from previous agent
2. **Knowledge Query Interface**: Allow agents to search historical context
3. **Context Validation**: Verify context relevance before using cached results

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Context Freshness Validation

Cached context must include staleness indicators:
- File modification timestamps
- Dependency version changes
- Environmental state drift
- Explicit invalidation triggers

### 2. Cross-Agent Context Handoffs

Context must survive agent transitions:
- Standardized context formats
- Version-controlled context evolution
- Context compression for long-running projects
- Context archaeology for debugging

### 3. Context Conflict Resolution

When multiple agents modify shared context:
- Context merge strategies
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Manual resolution prompts
- Context rollback capabilities

## Proposed Voting Options

**Option A: Hybrid Context Architecture**
- Immediate PostToolUse capture with intelligent context processing
- Tiered storage with automatic context degradation
- Agent-aware context briefing system

**Option B: Pure Context Substitution**
- Replace all command re-execution with context retrieval
- Aggressive context caching with semantic matching
- Context-first decision making for all agents

**Option C: Adaptive Context Strategy**
- Context complexity scales with command importance
- Agent-specific context preferences
- Dynamic context freshness validation

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**: Context staleness leading to incorrect decisions
**Medium Risk**: Context storage bloat affecting performance
**Low Risk**: Agent confusion from over-contextualization

## Recommendation

Implement **Option A** with emphasis on context intelligence and agent handoff protocols. The goal should be building a persistent knowledge layer that makes future agents smarter, not just preventing command re-execution.
