# Start automated monitoring (in another terminal)
./wave-transition-manager.sh monitor job-20250812-143022 60
```

**Dashboard shows:**
```
🌊 CLAUDE AUTO-TEE WAVE EXECUTION DASHBOARD
==========================================

Job ID: job-20250812-143022
Started: 2025-08-12T14:30:22Z
Updated: 2025-08-12T14:35:45Z

Wave Execution Status
=====================

🌊 Wave 1: 0/3 ready [⚙️⚙️⚙️]
🌊 Wave 2: NOT INITIALIZED
🌊 Wave 3: NOT INITIALIZED

Overall Progress: 0/3 waves complete (0%)
Active Wave: 1

Team Details
============
Wave 1 Teams:
  👥 team1: 🔧 WORKING - No PR created yet
  👥 team2: 🔧 WORKING - No PR created yet  
  👥 team3: 🔧 WORKING - No PR created yet
```

### Step 3: Simulate Team Work

Now teams would work in their isolated worktrees:

```bash
# Team 1 example workflow
cd ~/claude-wave-worktrees/claude-auto-tee-job-20250812-143022/team1-wave-1/

# Check team status
./team-scripts/sync-status.sh

# View assigned tasks
cat ~/claude-wave-workstream-sync/job-20250812-143022/assignments/team1-wave-1-tasklist.md

# Teams do their work...
# (editing files, making commits, etc.)

# Check readiness to create PR
./team-scripts/validate-pr-ready.sh

# Create PR when work is complete
gh pr create --title "Wave 1 - Team 1" --body "Completed wave 1 tasks"

# After PR is merged, mark wave complete
./team-scripts/mark-wave-complete.sh
```

### Step 4: Wave Transition

As teams complete their work:

```bash
# Dashboard updates in real-time
🌊 Wave 1: 1/3 ready [✅⚙️⚙️]  # Team 1 complete
🌊 Wave 1: 2/3 ready [✅✅⚙️]  # Team 2 complete
🌊 Wave 1: 3/3 ready [✅✅✅]  # All teams complete

🚀 Wave 1: READY FOR TRANSITION (3/3) [✅✅✅]
```

The automated transition manager detects completion and transitions to Wave 2:

```bash
# Transition manager output
🔍 Transition Check #15 - 14:45:32
==================================
🌊 Checking wave 1 completion...
🚀 Wave 1 ready for transition!
[SUCCESS] ✅ Wave 1 → 2 transition complete
🌊 Wave 2 is ready to begin
```

### Step 5: Quality Gates

Before each transition, quality gates run automatically:

```bash
# Quality validation example
🔍 Quality Gate Validation Report
==================================
Job ID: job-20250812-143022
Wave: 1
Teams: team1 team2 team3

👥 Validating Team: team1
========================
  📄 Ready file integrity: ✅ PASS
  🔗 PR merge validation: ✅ PASS
  🌿 Branch quality: ✅ PASS
  🔧 Code quality: ✅ PASS
  📋 Task completion: ✅ PASS

✅ Team team1: All validations passed

🎉 QUALITY GATE PASSED - Wave 1 ready for transition
```

### Step 6: Emergency Scenarios

Demonstrate emergency stop and recovery:

```bash
# Simulate emergency stop
./wave-launcher.sh emergency-stop job-20250812-143022 "critical-bug-found"

# Dashboard shows emergency state
⚠️  EMERGENCY STOP ACTIVE ⚠️
All wave transitions are halted
Reason: critical-bug-found

# Create backup during emergency
./wave-safety-manager.sh backup job-20250812-143022 "emergency-backup"

# Resume after issue resolution
./wave-launcher.sh resume job-20250812-143022
```

### Step 7: Complete Execution

Continue through all waves:

```bash
# Wave 2 setup (automated after Wave 1 completion)
# - 10 teams with 4-5 tasks each
# - Larger team coordination
# - More complex monitoring

# Wave 3 setup (automated after Wave 2 completion)  
# - 5 teams with 4 tasks each
# - Final integration tasks
# - Project completion

# Final completion
🎉 PROJECT COMPLETE! All waves finished.
```

## 📊 Demo Results

### System Performance

```bash
# Generate final reports
./wave-dashboard.sh html job-20250812-143022 final-report.html
./wave-quality-gates.sh report job-20250812-143022 quality-report.md
./wave-safety-manager.sh health job-20250812-143022
```

**Expected outcomes:**
- **Timeline:** 3-7 days depending on team size
- **Team Independence:** Zero coordination overhead within waves
- **Quality:** 100% PR merge requirement enforced
- **Safety:** Comprehensive backup and recovery capabilities
- **Monitoring:** Real-time visibility into all team progress

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Demo Result |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Wave 1 Duration | 1-2 days | Varies by team speed |
| Wave 2 Duration | 2-3 days | Scales with team count |
| Wave 3 Duration | 1-2 days | Integration focused |
| Sync Overhead | <2 hours total | Minimal with automation |
| Team Utilization | >90% parallel | Perfect within waves |
| Quality Gate Pass Rate | 100% | Enforced automatically |

## 🛠️ Advanced Demo Scenarios

### Large Team Simulation

```bash
# Set up for 15+ teams
./wave-launcher.sh quick-start
# Configure: Wave 1: 6 teams, Wave 2: 15 teams, Wave 3: 8 teams

# Monitor scaling behavior
./wave-dashboard.sh live job-large --detailed
```

### Multi-Site Coordination

```bash
# Simulate teams across time zones
# Teams work asynchronously
# Coordination via GitHub issues and filesystem sync
# Monitor progress across regions
```

### Failure Recovery

```bash
# Simulate various failure scenarios:

# 1. Team worktree corruption
./git-worktree-manager.sh cleanup job-demo
# Recreate team worktrees

# 2. Sync directory corruption  
./wave-safety-manager.sh restore job-demo backup-timestamp

# 3. Quality gate failures
./wave-quality-gates.sh validate job-demo 1 team1
# Address issues and re-validate

# 4. GitHub integration issues
gh auth login  # Re-authenticate
./wave-quality-gates.sh check-pr job-demo 1 team1
```

## 🎯 Demo Validation

### Success Criteria

✅ **Team Independence:** Teams work without inter-team coordination  
✅ **Wave Synchronization:** Hard barriers between waves enforced  
✅ **Quality Gates:** PR merge requirement validated  
✅ **Safety Features:** Emergency stop and recovery work correctly  
✅ **Monitoring:** Real-time visibility into progress  
✅ **Automation:** Transitions happen automatically  
✅ **Scalability:** System handles 3-15+ teams effectively  

### Performance Validation

```bash
# Check system responsiveness
time ./wave-dashboard.sh show job-demo  # <5 seconds
time ./wave-sync-coordinator.sh status job-demo 1  # <2 seconds
time ./wave-quality-gates.sh validate job-demo 1  # <30 seconds
```

### Integration Validation

```bash
# GitHub integration
gh pr list --search "Wave"  # Shows team PRs
gh issue list --search "Coordination"  # Shows coordination issues

# Filesystem coordination
ls ~/claude-wave-workstream-sync/job-demo/wave-*/  # Shows ready files
find ~/.claude-wave-backups/ -name "*job-demo*"  # Shows backups
```

## 📝 Demo Cleanup

# Archive demo results
./wave-dashboard.sh html job-demo demo-results.html
./wave-quality-gates.sh report job-demo demo-quality.md

# Clean up demo environment
./wave-safety-manager.sh backup job-demo "demo-complete"
./git-worktree-manager.sh cleanup job-demo

# Archive coordination data
