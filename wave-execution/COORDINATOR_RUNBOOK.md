# Job Coordinator Runbook

This runbook provides comprehensive instructions for coordinators managing wave-based execution jobs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Coordinator Responsibilities

As a job coordinator, you are responsible for:

1. âœ… Job initialization and team setup
2. âœ… Task assignment and distribution
3. âœ… Monitoring wave progress and transitions
4. âœ… Quality gate validation
5. âœ… Emergency response and issue resolution
6. âœ… Final project delivery coordination

## ðŸš€ Job Setup and Initialization

### 1. Pre-Flight Checklist

Before starting a wave execution job:

```bash
# Verify prerequisites
command -v jq >/dev/null || echo "Install jq: brew install jq"
command -v gh >/dev/null || echo "Install GitHub CLI: brew install gh"
gh auth status || echo "Authenticate: gh auth login"

# Verify project structure
[ -f "TASKS_WAVES.json" ] || echo "TASKS_WAVES.json not found"
[ -f "TASKS.md" ] || echo "TASKS.md not found (optional)"

# Test wave execution scripts
./wave-safety-manager.sh help >/dev/null && echo "âœ… Scripts accessible"
```

### 2. Initialize Job Environment

```bash
# Create unique job ID
JOB_ID="job-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
echo "Job ID: $JOB_ID"

# Initialize sync environment
./wave-sync-coordinator.sh init "$JOB_ID"

# Verify initialization
ls -la "$HOME/claude-wave-workstream-sync/$JOB_ID/"

# Create initial backup
./wave-safety-manager.sh backup "$JOB_ID" "initial-setup"
```

### 3. Plan Team Assignments

Review the wave structure and plan team assignments:

```bash
# View wave configuration
cat TASKS_WAVES.json | jq '.waves'

# Wave 1: 18 tasks - plan for 3-6 teams
# Wave 2: 46 tasks - plan for 8-15 teams  
# Wave 3: 20 tasks - plan for 4-8 teams

# Example assignment strategies:
```

**Option A: Balanced Teams (6 teams per wave)**
- Wave 1: 6 teams Ã— 3 tasks each
- Wave 2: 6 teams Ã— 7-8 tasks each
- Wave 3: 6 teams Ã— 3-4 tasks each

**Option B: Specialized Teams (varying team counts)**
- Wave 1: 3 teams Ã— 6 tasks each
- Wave 2: 10 teams Ã— 4-5 tasks each
- Wave 3: 5 teams Ã— 4 tasks each

## ðŸ“‹ Wave 1 Execution

### 1. Assign Wave 1 Tasks

```bash
# Example: 3 teams with 6 tasks each
./wave-sync-coordinator.sh assign "$JOB_ID" 1 "alpha:6,beta:6,gamma:6"

# Example: 6 teams with 3 tasks each
./wave-sync-coordinator.sh assign "$JOB_ID" 1 "team1:3,team2:3,team3:3,team4:3,team5:3,team6:3"

# Verify assignments
ls -la "$HOME/claude-wave-workstream-sync/$JOB_ID/assignments/"
```

### 2. Create Team Worktrees

```bash
# Create worktree for each team
for team in alpha beta gamma; do
    ./git-worktree-manager.sh create "$team" 1 "$JOB_ID"
done

# Verify worktrees
./git-worktree-manager.sh list "$JOB_ID"
```

### 3. Create Coordination Issue

```bash
# Create GitHub issue for wave coordination
./git-worktree-manager.sh issue 1 "$JOB_ID"

# Note the issue URL for team communication
```

### 4. Start Monitoring

```bash
# Start automated monitoring (in background)
nohup ./wave-transition-manager.sh monitor "$JOB_ID" 60 > wave-monitor.log 2>&1 &

# Start live dashboard (in separate terminal)
./wave-dashboard.sh live "$JOB_ID" --detailed

# Manual status checks
./wave-sync-coordinator.sh status "$JOB_ID" 1 "alpha,beta,gamma"
```

### 5. Monitor Wave 1 Progress

**Daily Activities:**
```bash
# Morning status check
./wave-transition-manager.sh status "$JOB_ID"

# Review team progress
./wave-dashboard.sh show "$JOB_ID" --detailed

# Check for issues
./wave-safety-manager.sh health "$JOB_ID"
```

**Team Support:**
- Monitor GitHub coordination issue for team questions
- Help teams with worktree or PR issues
- Validate team readiness when they report completion

**Wave 1 Completion:**
- All teams create ready.txt files (after PR merges)
- Automated transition manager detects completion
- Quality gate validation runs automatically
- GitHub issue updated with completion status

## ðŸ“‹ Wave 2 Execution

### 1. Wave 1 â†’ Wave 2 Transition

When Wave 1 completes:

```bash
# Verify wave 1 completion
./wave-sync-coordinator.sh status "$JOB_ID" 1 "alpha,beta,gamma"

# Run quality gate validation
./wave-quality-gates.sh validate "$JOB_ID" 1

# Check transition status
./wave-transition-manager.sh status "$JOB_ID"
```

**Transition should happen automatically, but if manual intervention needed:**

```bash
# Manual transition (if automated system has issues)
./wave-transition-manager.sh transition "$JOB_ID" 1 "alpha,beta,gamma"
```

### 2. Assign Wave 2 Tasks

```bash
# Wave 2 has 46 tasks - more teams needed
# Example: 10 teams with 4-5 tasks each
./wave-sync-coordinator.sh assign "$JOB_ID" 2 "team1:5,team2:5,team3:5,team4:5,team5:5,team6:4,team7:4,team8:4,team9:4,team10:4"
```

### 3. Create Wave 2 Worktrees

```bash
# Create worktrees for wave 2 teams
for team in team1 team2 team3 team4 team5 team6 team7 team8 team9 team10; do
    ./git-worktree-manager.sh create "$team" 2 "$JOB_ID"
done

# Create wave 2 coordination issue
./git-worktree-manager.sh issue 2 "$JOB_ID"
```

### 4. Monitor Wave 2 Progress

```bash
# Update monitoring for wave 2
./wave-sync-coordinator.sh monitor "$JOB_ID" 2 "team1,team2,team3,team4,team5,team6,team7,team8,team9,team10" 30

# Continue dashboard monitoring
./wave-dashboard.sh live "$JOB_ID" --detailed
```

## ðŸ“‹ Wave 3 Execution

### 1. Wave 2 â†’ Wave 3 Transition

```bash
# Verify wave 2 completion
./wave-sync-coordinator.sh status "$JOB_ID" 2

# Quality gate validation
./wave-quality-gates.sh validate "$JOB_ID" 2

# Monitor transition
./wave-transition-manager.sh status "$JOB_ID"
```

### 2. Assign Wave 3 Tasks

```bash
# Wave 3 has 20 tasks - fewer teams needed
# Example: 5 teams with 4 tasks each
./wave-sync-coordinator.sh assign "$JOB_ID" 3 "final1:4,final2:4,final3:4,final4:4,final5:4"
```

### 3. Final Wave Execution

```bash
# Create wave 3 worktrees
for team in final1 final2 final3 final4 final5; do
    ./git-worktree-manager.sh create "$team" 3 "$JOB_ID"
done

# Create final coordination issue
./git-worktree-manager.sh issue 3 "$JOB_ID"

# Monitor completion
./wave-sync-coordinator.sh monitor "$JOB_ID" 3 "final1,final2,final3,final4,final5"
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Emergency Stop

When critical issues arise:

```bash
# Immediate stop
./wave-safety-manager.sh emergency-stop "$JOB_ID" "critical-issue-description"

# Create emergency backup
./wave-safety-manager.sh backup "$JOB_ID" "emergency-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Notify all teams via GitHub issues
# Assess and resolve the critical issue
# Resume when safe
./wave-safety-manager.sh resume "$JOB_ID"
```

#### Rollback Procedures

If a wave transition needs to be rolled back:

```bash
# Create safety backup
./wave-safety-manager.sh backup "$JOB_ID" "pre-rollback"

# Reset team ready states as needed
./wave-safety-manager.sh reset-team "$JOB_ID" {WAVE} {TEAM} "rollback-reason"

# Restore from previous backup if needed
./wave-safety-manager.sh list-backups "$JOB_ID"
./wave-safety-manager.sh restore "$JOB_ID" {BACKUP_TIMESTAMP}
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quality Management

### Pre-Transition Quality Gates

Before each wave transition:

```bash
# Comprehensive validation
./wave-quality-gates.sh validate "$JOB_ID" {WAVE}

# Individual team validation
for team in {TEAMS}; do
    ./wave-quality-gates.sh validate "$JOB_ID" {WAVE} "$team"
done

# Generate quality report
./wave-quality-gates.sh report "$JOB_ID" "wave-${WAVE}-quality.md"
```

### Quality Metrics Tracking

Track quality throughout execution:

```bash
# Daily quality reports
./wave-quality-gates.sh report "$JOB_ID" "quality-$(date +%Y%m%d).md"

# PR merge success rate
# Ready file integrity rate
# Code quality issue counts
# Rollback frequency
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Completion

### Final Wave Completion

When Wave 3 completes:

```bash
# Verify all waves complete
./wave-transition-manager.sh status "$JOB_ID"

# Final quality validation
./wave-quality-gates.sh validate "$JOB_ID" 3

# Generate completion report
./wave-dashboard.sh html "$JOB_ID" "final-completion-report.html"
./wave-quality-gates.sh report "$JOB_ID" "final-quality-report.md"
```

### Cleanup and Archival

```bash
# Create final backup
./wave-safety-manager.sh backup "$JOB_ID" "project-complete"

# Generate final documentation
./wave-dashboard.sh html "$JOB_ID" "project-summary.html"

# Archive coordination files
tar -czf "${JOB_ID}-coordination-archive.tar.gz" \
    "$HOME/claude-wave-workstream-sync/$JOB_ID"

# Clean up worktrees (optional)
./git-worktree-manager.sh cleanup "$JOB_ID"
```

### Success Metrics Evaluation

Evaluate project success:

- **Timeline:** Did we meet the target completion time?
- **Quality:** Were quality gates consistently passed?
- **Team Efficiency:** How well did teams work independently?
- **Issue Resolution:** How quickly were issues resolved?
- **Coordination Overhead:** Was sync overhead minimal?

## ðŸ“š Advanced Coordination

### Multi-Site Coordination

For distributed teams:

```bash
# Coordinate across time zones
# Adjust monitoring intervals for global coverage
# Plan wave transitions for optimal overlap
# Use GitHub issues for asynchronous communication
```

### Large Team Management

For 15+ teams:

```bash
# Increase monitoring frequency
./wave-transition-manager.sh monitor "$JOB_ID" 30

# Use more specialized team assignments
# Create team lead hierarchy
# Implement additional quality checks
```

### Custom Validation

Add project-specific validation:

```bash
# Extend wave-quality-gates.sh
# Add custom validation scripts
# Integrate with project-specific CI/CD
# Add performance benchmarks
```

## ðŸ†˜ Escalation and Support

### When to Escalate

Escalate issues when:
- Multiple teams blocked simultaneously
- Critical system failures affecting coordination
- Quality gates consistently failing
- Timeline at serious risk

### Incident Response

For major incidents:

1. **Immediate Response**
   ```bash
   ./wave-safety-manager.sh emergency-stop "$JOB_ID" "incident-description"
   ./wave-safety-manager.sh backup "$JOB_ID" "incident-backup"
   ```

2. **Assessment**
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess impact scope
   - Determine recovery plan

3. **Resolution**
   - Implement fixes
   - Validate resolution
   - Resume operations

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update procedures
   - Improve monitoring
